Patents

Payment methods accepted by the Office:

The payment of fees must be effected in pounds sterling. All payments must be
made together with the filing of the form related to the fee to be paid, and
indicate the application number (national, if already known; international, if
the national application number is not yet known), the name of the applicant
and the type of the fee being paid.

The Office does not accept bank card payments for international patent fees
(except for the transmittal fee). Details are available at Intellectual
Property Office: how to pay us -
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intellectual-property-office-how-
to-pay-us>

Fees may be paid by any of the following means:  
— by certain types of credit/debit card;  
— by cheque drawn on a UK clearing bank;  
— by debit to a client deposit account held by the Office;  
— by direct bank-to-bank transfer to:

Barclays Bank Plc.  
3rd Floor Windsor Court  
3 Windsor Place  
Cardiff  
CF10 3ZL

Sort Code  
20-18-23

SWIFT Code  
BARCGB22

IBAN  
GB92 BARC 2018 2380 5317 66

For the credit of the Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) account
80531766; in cash at the Office.

Fees paid by a cheque expressed in pounds sterling are regarded as being paid
on the day of receipt of the cheque in the Office. Where cheques expressed in
other currencies are received, there will be a delay while realisation into
pounds sterling takes place (also, owing to currency fluctuations, an
underpayment could result); it is therefore recommended that pound sterling
cheques only should be paid. Cheques should be made payable to “UK
Intellectual Property Office.” Fees paid by bank-to-bank transfer are regarded
as being received at the date on which the bank credits the money to the
Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) account 80531766; however, bank-
to-bank transfers are likely to incur bank charges which may result in
underpayment of fees. These must be met by the applicant and therefore should
be covered in the applicant’s instruction to the bank. The application/renewal
documents relating to the payment of fees should be supported by a Fee Sheet
or equivalent form listing individual fees. A reference (e.g., patent or
deposit account number) should be quoted to link payment with any forms sent
separately; this is essential when a bank-to-bank transfer is made.

Availability under the national law for an international-type search (PCT
Article 15):

None

Provisional protection after international publication:

Where the designation is made for the purposes of a national patent:

Refer to Sections 89, 89A and 89B of the Patents Act 1977. The publication of
the international application in English by the International Bureau of WIPO,
or of the translation into English by the Intellectual Property Office5
(United Kingdom), gives the applicant generally the same right as he would
have had, if the patent had been granted on the date of publication of the
application or of the translation, to bring proceedings in the court or before
the Comptroller for damages in respect of any act which would have infringed a
patent. However, such proceedings may only be brought after grant of the
patent. Section 89B(3), in addition, gives effect to the option specified in
PCT Article 29(2)(iii)

Where the designation is made for the purposes of a European patent:

Refer to Sections 78(7) and 79(3) of the Patents Act 1977

(1) International application published in English: the right referred to
above applies once the application has been published by the International
Bureau of WIPO

(2) International application published in French or German: the right
referred to in paragraph (1) does not become effective until a translation
into English of the claims has been filed at, and published by, the
Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) and the prescribed fee paid, or
unless the applicant has supplied the infringer, before the infringing act
occurred, with a translation into English of the claims

(3) International application published in a language which is not an EPO
official language: the right referred to above does not become effective until
the EPO republishes the international application supplied to it in one of its
official languages except that if the EPO republishes the application in
French or German, paragraph (2) applies

may be filed electronically via the Office’s website or EPO online services .

Refer to <http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-file-documents-
with-the-intellectual-property-office> for further details of the Office’s
online filing services

GB.02 TRANSLATION (CORRECTION)

PR Rule 105  
Errors in the translation of the international application can be corrected
with reference to the text of the international application as filed (refer to
National Phase, paragraphs 6.002 and 6.003). A request for correction must be
made in writing and identify the proposed correction.

GB.03 FEES (MANNER OF PAYMENT)

The manner of payment of the fees indicated in the Summary and in this Chapter
is outlined in Annex GB.I.

GB.04 ADDRESS FOR SERVICE

PR Rules 101,  PR Rules 103  
An applicant, whether or not he is a national of or a resident in the United
Kingdom, is not required to be represented by an agent, but he is required to
have an address for service (of notices and other communications) in the
United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands or Gibraltar for the
purpose of his application. Every person (including the applicant for, or
proprietor of, a patent), concerned in any contested proceedings to which the
Patents Rules 2007 relate, must furnish the Office with an address for service
in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands or Gibraltar. If
an agent is appointed to represent the applicant for the entry into the
national phase, a written authorization is not required, though the agent must
be prepared to prove his authority to act if called upon to do so by the
Office. If an agent is appointed after the national phase has begun or one
agent is substituted for another, written authorization should be filed on
Patents Form 51.

GB.05 DESIGNATION OF THE INVENTOR

PA Sec. 13(2),  PA Sec. 89B(1)(c),  PR Rules 68(1),  PR Rules 68(2)  
Any statement of the name of the inventor under the Treaty is treated as a
statement filed under the national law. Otherwise details should be given on
Patents Form 7. Legalization is not required. For time limits, refer to the
Summary.

GB.06 RESTORATION OF THE RIGHT OF PRIORITY

PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2,  PA Sec. 5(2B),  PR Rules 7,  PR Rules 66(3)  
Where the international application was filed within two months from the end
of the period for claiming priority of an earlier application, a request may
be made to the Office in accordance with the national law to make a late
declaration of priority (refer to National Phase, paragraphs 6.006 - 6.011).
Such a request will be allowed if the Office is satisfied that the failure to
file the application within the 12 month priority period was unintentional.
The request must be made on Patents Form 3 and must be supported by evidence
of why the international application was not filed before the end of the
priority period. The time limit for filing the request is one month from the
date of entry into the national phase.

GB.07 PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION AND REQUEST FOR SEARCH

PA Sec. 15A,  PA Sec. 17(1),  PR Rules 68(1),  PR Rules 68(2),  PR Rules 106  
Preliminary examination (as to formal requirements) will be performed shortly
after payment of the national fee upon entry into the national phase. Search
must be requested on Patents Form 9A together with the payment of the fee for
search indicated in Annex GB.I within the time limits stated in the Summary.
Where an international search report has been established, a reduced search
fee is payable (refer to the Summary). A further reduction to the search fee
is applicable when Patents Form 9A is filed electronically. If the application
includes more than 25 claims, an excess claims fee of GBP 20 per claim is also
payable with the Form 9A. For the request for substantive examination, refer
to paragraph GB.09.

GB.08 REQUEST FOR PUBLICATION OF TRANSLATION

PA Sec. 69,  PA Sec. 89A(6),  PA Sec. 89B(3)  
If the international application has not been published by the International
Bureau in English, the English translation furnished by the applicant will be
published by the Office _ex officio_. However, if the applicant wants to
secure the rights conferred by that publication (refer to International Phase,
Annex B(GB), “Provisional protection after international publication”), he
must file a request in writing for publication of the translation or complete
Part 6 of Form NP1 and pay the publication fee (refer to Annex GB.I). That
request can be filed at any time after the start of the national phase.
However, it is advisable to request publication when entering the national
phase.

GB.09 REQUEST FOR SUBSTANTIVE EXAMINATION

PA Sec. 18(1),  PR Rule 68(1),  PR Rule 68(4)  
A patent will be granted only after examination as to patentability, which
must be requested by the applicant. The request for substantive examination
must be made on Patents Form 10.

The Office’s combined search and examination procedure for applications on
which Patents Forms 9A and 10 are filed together does not apply to
applications entering the national phase where an international search report
has been established. The time limits for requesting substantive examination
and the required fee are as stated in the Summary. A reduced examination fee
is payable when Patents Form 10 is filed electronically. If the application
includes more than 35 pages of description, an excess pages fee of GBP 10 per
page is also payable with the Form 10.

GB.10 TRANSLATION OF REFERENCES CITED IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH REPORT OR
INTERNATIONAL PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION REPORT

PR Rules 108(1),  PR Rules 113(5),  PR Rules 113(6)  
The Office may request the applicant to furnish a translation into English of
any document referred to in the international search report or international
preliminary report on patentability or cited in the international preliminary
examination report. Such a translation must be filed within two months of the
date of the request. There is no form for the furnishing of the translation.
This time limit of two months may be extended by the Office if it thinks fit;
a request for an extension should be made in writing (there is no form for
this purpose) and may be made even when the two-month time limit has already
expired.

GB.11 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION; TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41  
The applicant may make amendments to the application of his own volition under
the following conditions, provided that no new matter is introduced in the
disclosure of the invention:

PR Rule 66A,  PR Rule 31(3)  
(i) before the dispatch of the first substantive examination report:

(a) where an international search report was issued during the international
phase, the applicant may amend the specification voluntarily from the date of
national phase entry until the date the first substantive examination report
is issued;

(b) where no international search report has been issued by the time the
application enters the UK national phase, the period within which the
applicant may amend voluntarily starts from the date of issue of the UK search
report or the international search report (whichever is issued first) and ends
on the date the first substantive examination report is issued.

(ii) after the dispatch of the first report referred to in (i), above:

PR Rule 31(4)  
(a) amendments to the application may be made only once; such amendments must
be made either at the same time as any amendments made so as to comply with
the examiner’s report or within two months of the dispatch of the said report
when it does not require any amendment;

PR Rule 31(5),  PR Rule 31(6),  PR Rule 31(1)  
(b) any further amendment to the application may be made only with the consent
of the Office; in this case, the applicant must provide the reasons for the
amendment in writing.

Amendments should be effected by filing replacement pages.

GB.12 CORRECTION OF ERRORS

PA Sec. 14(10),  PA Sec. 117,  PA Sec. 117A,  PR Rules 49(2),  PR Rules 105  
The applicant may request the correction of an error of translation or
transcription or a clerical error or mistake in the application or any
document filed in connection therewith at any time. The request must be made
in writing and identify the proposed correction. A request for correction of a
name must be made on Patents Form 20. Erroneous withdrawals may be corrected
in this way but the resuscitated application will be subject to third party
terms for the period between the withdrawal of the application and the notice
of request for correction being published.

GB.13 PERIOD FOR PUTTING THE APPLICATION IN ORDER

PA Sec. 20,  PA Sec. 21,  PR Rules 30,  PR Rules 108  
An application will be treated as having been refused unless it complies with
all requirements of the Patents Act and Rules within four years and six months
from the priority date or one year from the date of the first substantive
examination report (whichever is later), with the possibility of two months’
extension as of right or a longer extension at the discretion of the Office
(refer to paragraph GB.17). If a third party files observations relevant to
patentability and the first substantive examination report based on those
observations is sent during the last three months of the period outlined
above, the period becomes three months beginning with the date on which the
report is sent.

GB.14 RENEWAL FEES

PA Sec. 25(3),  PA Sec. 25(4),  PR Rule 36-39  
After a patent has been granted, a fee must be paid for maintaining the patent
in force, starting with the fifth year counted from the international filing
date. Payment must be made each year during the period of three full calendar
months which ends on the last day of the month in which the filing date falls.
Payment can still be made, together with a surcharge, during a further period
of six full months. Where a patent is granted in the last three months of the
fourth year, or later, the renewal fee may be paid without surcharge by the
end of the third calendar month after the date of grant or, with a surcharge,
within six months from the end of these three months. The amounts of the
renewal fees and of the surcharge are indicated in Annex GB.I. Form 12 must be
filed (refer to also paragraph GB.21).

GB.15 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

PCT Art. 25,  PCT Rule 51,  PA Sec. 89(3),  PA Sec. 89(5),  PA Sec. 97(1),  PR
Rule 71  
The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. (The Patents Act also includes a similar procedure for which
application may be made at any time by writing to the Office with a statement
of the facts relied on and paying any fee indicated in Annex GB.I.)

If, upon review under PCT Article 25, the Office finds that the refusal to
accord a filing date or declaration that the international application is
considered withdrawn was not the result of an error or omission on the part of
the receiving Office or the International Bureau, the applicant may ask for a
hearing, if he wishes to contest the Office’s view; if the hearing (which the
applicant is not obliged to attend in person) maintains the Office’s view, a
reasoned written decision will be issued. An appeal may be lodged against such
a decision in the Patents Court within 28 days from the decision; it must be
accompanied by the related fee indicated in Annex GB.I. An application to
extend the 28 day time limit must be made direct to the Court.

GB.16 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2),  PCT Art. 48(2)  
Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.027 of the National Phase.

GB.17 EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS

PR Rule 108  
The time limits for filing Patents Form NP1 (National processing of an
international application for a patent (UK)), Patents Form 9A (Request for
search), Patents Form 10 (Request for a substantive examination) and, where
necessary, Patents Form 7 (Statement of inventorship and of right to grant of
a patent) as well as the time limit for putting the application in order may
be extended as of right by two months on request and subject to the payment of
a fee (refer to Annex GB.I). The request for such an extension may be filed
even when the time limit has expired but must be filed before the end of the
extension sought using Patents Form 52. Further extensions of two months are
possible but only at the discretion of the Office and on filing of Patents
Form 52 and fee before the end of the extension sought together with and any
evidence required. If an application is terminated owing to a time period not
being met then reinstatement may be available (refer to paragraph GB.20
below).

GB.18

PR Rule 108  
The other time limits specifically referred to in the Summary may be extended
if the Office thinks fit. There is no special form for such a request.

GB.19

PA Sec. 117B,  PR Rule 109  
Time limits set by the Office (rather than by the Act or Rules) during the
national phase may be extended as of right by two months, or if sooner, to the
end of the period for putting the application in order (refer to paragraph
GB.13). A request for extension must be made in writing and within two months
of the expiry of the relevant period. There is no special form for the
request.

GB.20 REINSTATEMENT OF AN APPLICATION

PA Sec. 20A,  PA Sec. 20B,  PR Rule 32  
An application that has been terminated because a requirement was not met
within a prescribed or specified period may be reinstated on request if the
Office is satisfied that the failure to comply with the requirement was
unintentional. Reinstatement only applies when no extension of the period is
available and may only be requested within 12 months of termination of the
application. Third party terms will apply to the period between termination of
the application and the publication of the request for reinstatement. A
request for reinstatement must be made on Patents Form 14.

GB.21 RESTORATION OF A LAPSED PATENT

PA Sec. 28,  PA Sec. 28A,  PR Rule 40  
If a patent lapses through non-payment of renewal fees, then an application
for restoration may be made. For a lapsed patent to be restored the Office
must be satisfied that the failure to pay the renewal fee was unintentional.
Third party terms will apply to the period between expiry of the patent and
the publication of the request for restoration. A request for restoration must
be made on Patents Form 16.

indicate the application number (national, if already known; international, if
the national application number is not yet known), the name of the applicant
and the type of the fee being paid

Details are available at Intellectual Property Office: how to pay us  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intellectual-property-office-how-
to-pay-us>

Fees may be paid by any of the following means: by certain types of
credit/debit card; by cheque drawn on a  
UK clearing bank; by debit to a client deposit account held by the Office; by
direct bank-to-bank transfer to:

Fees paid by a cheque expressed in pounds sterling are regarded as being paid
on the day of receipt of the cheque in the Office. Where cheques expressed in
other currencies are received, there will be a delay while realisation into
pounds sterling takes place (also, owing to currency fluctuations, an
underpayment could result); it is therefore recommended that pound sterling
cheques only should be paid. Cheques should be made payable to “UK
Intellectual Property Office.” Fees paid by bank-to-bank transfer are regarded
as being received at the date on which the bank credits the money to the
Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) account 80531766; however, bank-
to-bank transfers are likely to incur bank charges which may result in
underpayment of fees. These must be met by the applicant and therefore should
be covered in the applicant’s instruction to the bank. The application/renewal
documents relating to the payment of fees should be supported by a Fee Sheet
or equivalent form listing individual fees. A reference (e.g., patent or
deposit account number) should be quoted to link payment with any forms sent
separately; this is essential when a bank-to-bank transfer is made

Notes:  
1 ^ a Patents Act 1977, Section 23.  
2 ^ a In most cases, a United Kingdom resident may file an application direct
at the European Patent Office or at the International Bureau of WIPO. However,
restrictions apply where the application contains information which relates to
military technology or which might be prejudicial to United Kingdom national
security or the safety of the public. In these cases, a United Kingdom
resident may only file such an application direct at the European Patent
Office or at the International Bureau of WIPO: (i) after having obtained
written authorization from the Office; or (ii) after an application for a
patent for the same invention has been filed at the Office and not less than
six weeks have elapsed without the Comptroller of the Office giving a
direction prohibiting publication or communication of the invention. These
restrictions do not apply to an application for a patent for an invention for
which an application for a patent has first been filed in a country outside
the United Kingdom by a person resident outside the United Kingdom. Further
details can be obtained from the Office: Security Section, Concept House,
Cardiff Road, Newport, South Wales, NP10 8QQ; tel: (44-1633) 81 35 58.  
3 ^ a b c Must be furnished or paid within the time limit applicable under PCT
Article 22 or 39(1), or at the time of any earlier express request by the
applicant to proceed earlier with the national phase.  
4 ^ a Where the translation of an amendment has not been furnished within the
applicable time limit (refer tofootnote 1), the amendment will be disregarded.
However, where the applicant has furnished a translation either of the
amendment or of the international application as originally filed, but not
both, the Office will, at the expiry of the applicable time limit, invite the
applicant to supply the missing translation.  
5 ^ a Where the applicant expressly requests entry into the national phase
earlier than the time limit applicable under PCT Article 22 or 39(1) and the
international application has not been communicated to the Office by the
International Bureau, the translation must also contain the request part of
the international application and the abstract.  
6 ^ a b Excess claims and excess pages fees are payable at the same time as
the search fee/substantive examination fee; they may also be payable at grant
if the number of claims and pages increase during the processing of the
application. If this is the case the Office will invite the applicant to pay a
grant fee by filing a Form 34.  
7 ^ a Due within 33 months from the priority date. Where the applicant
expressly requests early entry into the national phase, the fee is due within
12 months from the priority date, or two months from the date on which the
conditions for early entry are satisfied, whichever is the later.  
8 ^ a Due within 33 months from the priority date.  
9 ^ a Must be furnished within 33 months from the priority date. Where the
applicant expressly requests early entry into the national phase, the name and
address of the inventor must be furnished within 16 months from the priority
date, or two months from the date on which the conditions for early entry are
satisfied, whichever is the later (unless already furnished in the “Request”).  
10 ^ a This requirement may be satisfied if the corresponding declaration has
been made in accordance with PCT Rule 4.17.  
11 ^ a If not already complied with within the time limit applicable under PCT
Article 22 or 39(1), the Office will invite the applicant to comply with the
requirement within a time limit fixed in the invitation.
