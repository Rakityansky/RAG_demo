is outlined in Annex ZW.I.

ZW.03 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION

PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41,  ZPL Art. 37  
The applicant may amend or correct the international application at any time
up to the acceptance of the complete specification, provided that the scope of
the subject matter of the application is not broadened thereby, and that the
request is made in writing, states the nature of the amendment and the reasons
for the amendment. The request should be accompanied by the prescribed fee
(refer to Annex ZW.I). Requests for amendment of an accepted specification and
its nature and reasons therefor must be published by the applicant in the
Patent and Trade Marks Journal, and any person may notify the Registrar of
opposition to the amendment within three months of that publication.

correction of any procedural irregularity relating to proceedings before the
Registrar. Such corrections may be made upon request in writing accompanied by
the prescribed fee (refer to Annex ZW.I) or without such a request.

ZW.05 PUBLICATION

ZPL Art. 16,  ZPR Art. 24  
The applicant must publish a notice in the Patent and Trade Marks Journal upon
acceptance of the complete specification by the Registrar, and the application
form, specification and other documents are open to public inspection as of
the date of publication of that notice.

ZW.06 RENEWAL FEES

ZPL Art. 27,  ZPR Art. 37  
After a patent has been granted, renewal fees must be paid for maintaining the
patent in force. The first renewal fee is payable for the third year following
the international filing date. Payment of the annual fees for subsequent years
must be made before the anniversary of the international filing date. The
Registrar may, upon the request of the applicant and subject to the payment of
an additional fee, extend the time for payment of the renewal fee for a period
not exceeding six months. The amounts of the renewal fees are indicated in
Annex ZW.I. No renewal fees are payable for the renewal of a patent of
addition.

ZW.07 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.027 of the National Phase. Owners
of patents which have lapsed due to failure to pay any renewal fee within the
prescribed time limit may, within three years from the date on which the
patent lapsed, apply in the prescribed manner to the Registrar for restoration
of the lapsed patent. The request for restoration must contain a verified
statement setting out the circumstances which led to the failure to pay the
renewal fee. The Registrar may require the submission of additional evidence
or may permit the applicant to have a hearing. Where the Registrar is
satisfied that the failure to pay the renewal fee was unintentional and there
was no undue delay in making the request for restoration, the request for
restoration may be granted upon payment of the unpaid renewal fee and such
additional fee as may be prescribed (refer to Annex ZW.I), and after providing
for opposition to the request.

ZW.08 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

Court within three months after the date of the decision by the Tribunal, or
within such further time as the Patents Tribunal may allow.

international application, a patent of addition instead of a patent must have
been indicated, for international applications filed before 1 January 2004, in
the international application (in Box No. V of the request) when filed; for
