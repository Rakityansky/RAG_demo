##  The procedure in the national Phase

AT.01 TRANSLATION (CORRECTION)

Errors in the translation of the international application can be corrected
with reference to the text of the international application as filed (refer to
National Phase, paragraphs 6.002 and 6.003). If the translation furnished to
the Office contains only the description, the Office will invite the applicant
to furnish the missing part and will excuse the late furnishing provided that
the scope of the disclosure contained in the translation furnished to the
Office is not broadened thereby.

AT.02 FEES (MANNER OF PAYMENT)

The manner of payment of the fees indicated in the Summary and in this Chapter
is outlined in Annex AT.I.

AT.03 POWER OF ATTORNEY

PatG Sec. 21,  PatG Sec. 77  
An agent must be appointed by filing a power of attorney. An attorney-at-law,
a patent attorney or a notary may replace a power of attorney by a reference
to his authorization. A model of a power of attorney is given in Annex AT.II.

AT.04 MENTION OF INVENTOR

PatG Sec. 20  
The name of the inventor is mentioned by the Office in the Patent Register and
in the publication of the patent upon express request only. That request may
be made by the applicant or the inventor at any time, even after the
publication of the patent. Where several persons are entitled to make such
request, the requestor must produce proof that the other persons entitled
agree, unless the request is made jointly by all those entitled.

AT.05 ANNUAL FEES

PAG Sec. 6  
Annual fees for patents are only payable after publication in the Patent
Gazette [_Österreichisches Patentblatt_] of the granting of the patent. In
general, annual fees are only payable for the sixth year and the following
years (calculated on the basis of the last day of the month in which the
application was filed). However, no payment of annual fees is due before the
granting of the patent.

The annual fees must be paid within three months preceding the due date (the
last day of the month which corresponds to the month in which the application
was filed), but not later than six months after the due date. Payments made
after the due date will be subject to a late payment surcharge of 20% of the
applicable fee.

The amounts of the annual fees for national patents and utility models are
indicated in Annex AT.I.

AT.06 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION; TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41,  PatG Sec. 91(3)  
The applicant may make amendments to any part of the application up to the
decision to grant a patent, provided that the scope of the subject matter of
the application is not broadened thereby. It is to be noted that, during the
opposition procedure following the grant of the patent, amendments to the
description, claims or drawings may still be made, but only within the scope
of the patent as granted.

AT.07 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

PCT Art. 25,  PCT Rule 51,  PatG Sec. 70,  PatV Sec. 16(3)  
The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. If, upon review under PCT Article 25, the Office denies an
error or omission on the part of the receiving Office or the International
Bureau, an appeal against this decision may be lodged within two months from
the date of receipt of the decision. Within the same two-month time limit, a
fee for appeal must be paid (for the amount, refer to Annex AT.I). The Higher
Regional Court of Vienna will then decide on the appeal.

AT.08 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2),  PCT Art. 48(2),  PatG Sec. 129,  PatG Sec. 130,  PatG Sec.
131,  PatG Sec. 132,  PatG Sec. 133,  PatG Sec. 134,  PatG Sec. 135,  PatG
Sec. 136  
Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.027 of the National Phase.
Reinstatement may be requested where the applicant, due to an unforeseeable or
unavoidable event or in spite of due care required by the circumstances, has
failed to comply with a time limit before the Office and non-observance of the
time limit is detrimental to his rights. A request for reinstatement must be
presented in writing within two months after the removal of the cause of the
failure to perform the act but not later than one year from the expiration of
the time limit which has not been observed. Within these two months, the
omitted act must be completed, the procedural fee for reinstatement indicated
in Annex AT.I must be paid, and the request must state the facts which justify
the reinstatement and procedure evidence of those facts, unless they are well
known to the Office.

AT.09 UTILITY MODEL

PCT Art. 4(3),  PCT Art. 43,  PCT Art. 44,  PCT Rule 4.12,  PCT Rule 49
_bis_.1,  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(a),  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(b),  PCT Rule 76.5,
GMG Sec. 3(4),  GMG Sec. 13,  GMG Sec. 14,  GMG Sec. 15,  GMG Sec. 16,  GMG
Sec. 17  
If the applicant wishes to obtain utility model registration in Austria on the
basis of an international application

(i) instead of a patent, or

(ii) in addition to a patent,

subject to what is said in paragraph AT.13, the applicant, when entering the
national phase, shall so indicate to the Office. Utility model applications
must fulfill basically the same requirements as patent applications. However,
unlike patent applications, utility model applications enjoy a grace period in
which disclosure of the invention by the applicant or his legal predecessor is
not prejudicial to novelty provided that it did not take place more than six
months prior to the date of filing

AT.10

GMG Sec. 6,  GMG Sec. 18(1),  GMG Sec. 19,  GMG Sec. 27  
The term of protection of the utility model commences with its publication and
registration; the maximum term of protection for a utility model is 10 years
from the end of the month in which the application is filed. In normal
proceedings and where possible, if there are no objections to the publication
and registration of the utility model, the Office compiles a search report
within six months of the date of filing—the application procedure for utility
models does not involve substantive examination. The applicant may amend the
claims on receipt of the search report. Once proof of payment of the required
fees has been received, the utility model is registered and published on the
same date (in the Official Gazette). Additionally, applicants may request
accelerated proceedings (immediate publication and registration of their
utility model) when filing their application. Under that procedure, where no
objections arise from the formal examination and the proof of payment is
received, the utility model is published and registered within one to three
months from filing.

AT.11

PatV Sec. 16  
If the international application is for both a utility model and a patent, the
applicant must, within the time limit applicable for the entry into the
national phase, pay two fees for entry into the national phase (for the patent
application and the utility model application) and, where the international
application was not filed in the German language, furnish a translation into
German, and file a power of attorney (if any) in duplicate.

AT.12

PAG Sec. 16  
Annual fees are payable from the fourth year onwards, as from the last day of
the month of the filing date. In case the utility model is not published and
registered before three years from the last day of the month of the filing
date, annual fees are payable only for the years following the publication and
registration of the utility model. The amounts of the annual fees are
indicated in Annex AT.I.

AT.13 CONVERSION

PatG Sec. 92b,  GMG Sec. 21  
An international application for a patent may be converted into a utility
model application, and _vice versa_ , after the applicant has complied with
the requirements for the entry into the national phase as indicated in the
Summary. Conversion may be effected up to the date on which the decision is
taken to publish or reject the application. However, once a conversion has
taken place, a conversion back to the original status will not be possible.

AT.14 BRANCHING OFF

GMG Sec. 15a(1)  
A utility model application concerning the subject matter of an earlier
application for a patent that is valid in Austria may claim the filing date of
that earlier patent application provided the utility model application is
filed before the expiration of two months after the patent application is
considered withdrawn or finally rejected or after the opposition procedure, if
any, is terminated.

AT.15 RESTORATION OF THE RIGHT OF PRIORITY

PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2,  PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2(e)  
A declaration or other evidence in support of a request for restoration of the
right of priority should be filed within the time limit set out in PCT Rule 49
_ter_.2(b)(i).

If such a request is not accompanied by a declaration or other supporting
evidence it will not be refused _prima facie_ by the Office but the applicant
will be requested to furnish the required declaration within a time limit
which shall be reasonable under the circumstances.
