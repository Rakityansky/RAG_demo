##  The procedure in the national Phase

CN.01 FORM FOR ENTERING THE NATIONAL PHASE

The Office has available special forms for entering the national phase (refer
to Annex CN.II for invention applications and Annex CN.III for utility model
applications). These forms should preferably (but need not) be used when
effecting the payment of the national fee and for the furnishing of the
translation of the international application into Chinese. The forms are also
available on the Office’s website at <http://www.cnipa.gov.cn>.

CN.02 TRANSLATION (CORRECTION)

Errors in the translation of the international application can be corrected
with reference to the text of the international application as filed (refer to
National Phase, paragraphs 6.002 and 6.003).

CN.03 FEES (MANNER OF PAYMENT)

The manner of payment of the fees indicated in the Summary and in this Chapter
is outlined in Annex CN.I.

CN.04 REQUEST FOR EXAMINATION

CPL Art. 35,  CPR Rules 93,  CPR Rules 96  
The Office examines patent applications as to substance only upon a request
for examination and the payment of an examination fee which must be effected
within three years from the priority date. The amount of the examination fee
is indicated in Annex CN.I. A copy of the form for requesting examination is
contained in Annex CN.IV. The form is also available on the Office’s website
at <http://www.cnipa.gov.cn>.

CN.05 POWER OF ATTORNEY

CPR Rule 15  
An agent must be appointed by filing a power of attorney.

CN.06 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION; TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41,  CPR Rules 51,  CPR Rules 112  
With regard to an international application for a utility model, the applicant
may file a request with the Office to amend the description, drawings and
claims on his own initiative within two months from the date of entry into the
national phase. With regard to an international application for a patent of
invention, the applicant may amend the application on his own initiative at
the time when a request for examination is made, and within three months after
the receipt of the notification of the Office that the application has entered
into examination as to substance. Where the applicant wishes to amend the
application, to correct defects indicated in the notification of opinions of
the examination issued by the Office, such amendments shall be made within the
time limit set by the Office.

CN.07 INSTRUMENT OF ASSIGNMENT

The applicant is presumed to have the right to file the international
application and therefore no instrument of assignment is required if the
international application is filed by an entity for an employee invention made
by an inventor who is an employee of that entity. After the application is
filed, an instrument of assignment is required for each change if there is any
change in the person of the applicant.

CN.08 SPECIAL FEE IN CASE OF LACK OF UNITY OF INVENTION

PCT Art. 17(3)(b),  PCT Art. 34(3)(c),  CPR Rule 115  
Where a part of the international application was not subjected to
international search or preliminary examination because the international
application did not comply with the requirement of unity of invention and the
applicant did not pay the additional search or preliminary examination fee to
the International Searching or Preliminary Examination Authority, the Office
will decide whether the said finding as regards the application translated
into the Chinese language was correct. If this is found to be the case, the
Office will invite the applicant to pay a special fee within the time limit
fixed in the notification of this decision. The amount of the said fee is
indicated in Annex CN.I. Where the applicant does not pay the special fee,
that part of the international application which was not subjected to
international search or preliminary examination will be considered withdrawn.

CN.09 ANNUAL FEES

CPL Art. 43,  CPR Rules 54,  CPR Rules 98  
The first annual fee must be paid within two months from the receipt of the
notice from the Office of the grant of the patent. All subsequent annual fees
must be paid in advance within the month before the anniversary of the
international filing date. If the annual fee is not paid or not paid in full,
the Office will invite the applicant to pay it within six months from the
expiration of the time limit due, with a surcharge. Where the annual fee is
not paid within the prescribed time limit, the patent shall be deemed lapsed
from the expiration of the time limit within which the annual fee should have
been paid. The amounts of the annual fees are indicated in Annex CN.I.

CN.10 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

PCT Art. 25,  PCT Rule 51,  CPR Rule 116  
The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. Where an international application in the international phase
has not been accorded an international filing date or has been considered
withdrawn by one of the international authorities, the applicant may request
reconsideration by the Office.

CN.11 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2),  48(2),  PCT Rule 82 _bis_ ,  CPR Rule 103  
If the applicant fails to perform the acts necessary for entry into the
national phase within the prescribed time limit of 30 months, he may perform
the required acts before the expiration of a time limit of 32 months from the
priority date, provided that he pays a surcharge for late entry into the
national phase.

CN.12

CPR Rules 6,  CPR Rules 105  
Subject to CPR Rule 105, where, because of _force majeure_ , after having
performed the acts necessary for entering the national phase, the time limit
prescribed in the CPL or the CPR or specified by the Office is not observed,
resulting in the loss of any right, the applicant may request restoration of
his rights within two months from the date of the removal of the impediment,
or, at the latest, within two years from the expiration of the time limit.
Such a request should be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the failure
to meet the time limit and any relevant supporting documents. Where, because
of any justified reason, the time limit prescribed in the CPL of the CPR or
specified by the Office is not observed, resulting in the loss of any right,
the applicant may state the reasons and request the Office to restore his
rights, within two months from the date of receipt of a notification from the
Office.

CN.13 RESTORATION OF PRIORITY CLAIM

Where the International Bureau or the receiving Office has declared that the
priority claim is considered not to have been made according to PCT Rule 26
_bis_.2 and the related information has been published together with the
international application, the applicant may, when entering the national
phase, request restoration of the priority claim. The request for restoration
of the priority claim is subject to the payment of a fee (for the amount,
refer to Annex CN.I).

CN.14 UTILITY MODEL

CPR Rules 38,  CPR Rules 39,  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(a),  PCT Rule 76.5  
If the applicant wishes to obtain a utility model instead of a patent in
China, on the basis of an international application, the applicant, when
performing the acts referred to in PCT Article 22 or 39, shall so indicate to
the Office.

CN.15

The requirements for the national phase are basically the same as for patents,
except that for utility models a drawing must be furnished and no examination
as to substance is carried out. An international application for a patent may
not be converted into a utility model application, and _vice versa_.

CN.16 APPEALS

CPL Art. 41, CPR Rules 59, CPR Rules 60, CPR Rules 61, CPR Rules 62, CPR Rules
63, CPR Rules 64  
Where an international application is rejected in the national phase, the
applicant may, within three months from the date of receipt of the
notification, request reexamination and pay a reexamination fee.

been carried out by that Office.  
3 ^ a b c d e f g h The People’s Republic of China established the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (HKSAR) on 1
July 1997. The HKSAR operates an independent Patents Registry and all matters
relating to the grant, administration or litigation in relation to patents are
decided in the HKSAR according to the HKSAR’s Patents Ordinance (Cap. 514).
Patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration
(CNIPA) are not automatically protected in the HKSAR but the grant of a patent
by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) can form
the basis for patents in the HKSAR. In order to obtain patents via the PCT,
the applicant must designate China. Refer to paragraphs CN.17 to CN.19 of the
