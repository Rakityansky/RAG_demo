is outlined in Annex HR.I.

HR.05 APPOINTMENT OF AGENT

PL Art. 17  
An agent must be appointed by filing a power of attorney if the applicant is
not a resident in Croatia. A foreign legal or natural person may however,
without a representative, file a patent application, perform other acts
relating to the establishment of the filing date of a patent application, file
true copies of the first patent application (when claiming a priority right),
receive notifications relating to the above mentioned procedures and pay the
administrative fees and procedural charges. In these cases, a foreign legal or
natural person shall communicate to the Office the address for correspondence,
which shall be in the territory of Croatia.

HR.06 ANNUAL FEES

PL Art. 88  
Annual fees shall be paid to the Office from the third anniversary of the

The applicant may file a request for substantive examination until the expiry
of the six-month time limit after the publication of the search report in the

The applicant may amend or correct the international application up to the
grant of a patent, provided that the scope of the subject matter of the
application is not extended.

The applicant cannot amend the description, claims and drawings of the
application before having received a search report on the state of the art.
After receipt of the search report, the applicant may, of his own volition,
amend the description, claims and drawings once, provided that the amendment
is filed together with a response to the report.

HR.10 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

PCT Art. 25,  PCT Rule 51,  PCT Rule 82 _ter_ ,  PL Art. 18  
The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. If upon review under PCT Article 25, the Office denies an
error or omission on the part of the receiving Office or the International
Bureau, the decision issued by the Office cannot be appealed, but an
administrative dispute can be instituted before the Administrative court in
Zagreb. The procedure before the Administrative Court is deemed urgent.

HR.11 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2),  PCT Art. 48(2),  PCT Rule 49.6,  PCT Rule 82 _bis_  
Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.027 of the National Phase.

HR.12

PL Art. 28,  PReg. 6  
Reinstatement of rights may be requested where the applicant, in spite of all
due care required by the circumstances, failed to observe a time limit set by
the Office, which is prejudicial to his rights. A request for reinstatement
must be presented in writing within:

— three months after the removal of the cause of the failure to observe the
time limit or 12 months after the expiry of the missed time limit if the
request for reinstatement relates to the non-payment of maintenance fee, or

— 12 months after the expiry of the additional 6 months time limit for
payment, whichever time limit expires earlier.

Within the said time limits, the omitted action must be completed, the fee for
reinstatement of rights (refer to Annex HR.I) must be paid and the request
must set out the facts on which it relies.

HR.13

PL Art. 29  
Continued processing may be requested where the applicant failed to observe a
time limit fixed by the Office and that failure directly causes a loss of
rights conferred by a patent application or a patent. Continued processing may
not be requested for certain time limits set out in PL Art. 29. The request
for continued processing must be filed within two months from the day on which
the applicant learned of the legal consequences. The Office shall authorize
continued processing if the applicant files a request, performs all the
omitted acts within the time limit, and pays the prescribed fee.

HR.14 UTILITY MODEL

PL Art. 71,  PL Art. 72,  PL Art. 73,  PL Art. 74,  PL Art. 75,  PL Art. 76,

international application instead of a patent, the applicant, when performing
the acts referred to in Article 22 or 39, shall so indicate to the Office by
entering the national phase as a utility model application.

A utility model shall be registered for an invention whose subject-matter of
invention is patentable in compliance with the Patent Law. A utility model
shall not be registered for an invention in the field of biotechnology; a
chemical or pharmaceutical substance; an invention where its commercial
exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality, where exploitation
shall not be considered contrary to public order or morality only because such
exploitation is forbidden by law or another regulation; and an invention which
refers to a process.

The maximum term of protection of a utility model is 10 years from the date of
filing of the application for a utility model. The holder of a registered
utility model may request substantive examination to determine whether the
invention is new, inventive and industrially applicable. Such a request may be
submitted no later than upon expiry of the seventh year of duration of the
utility model (refer to Annex HR.III).
