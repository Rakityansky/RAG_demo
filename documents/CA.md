Under PCT Article 39(1)(a): 30 months from the priority date

12 months after the 30-month deadline (30 months from the priority date)
provided the applicant pays the fee for reinstatement of rights and meets the
other requirements outlined in subsection 154(3) of the Canadian Patent Rules
for the reinstatement of rights (late entry into the national phase)

Does the Office permit reinstatement of rights (PCT Rule 49.6)?

The Office has submitted a notice of incompatibility of PCT Rule 49.6 with its
national law. However, the Office does, as a designated office, permit
reinstatement of rights under subsection 154(3) of the Canadian Patent Rules.

Translation of international application required into (one of) the following
language(s):

English,

French

  

Must be furnished within the time limit applicable under PCT Article 22 or
39(1).

Required contents of the translation for entry into the national phase:

Under PCT Article 22: Description, other than any sequence listings, claims,
if the description or claims contained in the international application are
entirely in a language other than English or French (if amended, as amended
only, together with any statement under PCT Article 19)

Under PCT Article 39(1): Description, other than any sequence listings,
claims, if the description or claims contained in the international
application are entirely in a language other than English or French (if any of
those parts has been amended, only as amended by the annexes to the
international preliminary examination report)

Applicants may enter the national phase with untranslated portions of the
description or claims only where those elements of the international
application are partly in a language other than English or French; however,
untranslated text matter will not be taken into account for the purpose of
interpreting the scope of protection sought or obtained

Must be furnished within the time limit applicable under PCT Article 22 or
39(1).

Is a copy of the international application required in particular
circumstances?

The applicant is only required to send a copy of the international application

requests an earlier start of the national phase under PCT Article 23(2).

Does the Office accept color drawings under its national law?

No. Drawings must be in black, sufficiently dense and dark, well-defined lines
to permit legible reproduction and must not be photographs (Canadian Patent
Rules subsection 59(1)). However, if an invention does not admit of
illustration by means of drawings but does admit of illustration by means of
photographs, the applicant may furnish photographs (Canadian Patent Rules,
subsection 59(2)). Any such photograph can contain colour.

National fees:

Must be paid within the time limit applicable under PCT Article 22 or 39(1).

Errors in the translation of the international application may be corrected by
the applicant before the day on which a notice of allowance or notice of
conditional allowance is sent by submitting the corrected translation and a
required statement in accordance with subsection 155.2(2) of the Canadian

CA.03 LANGUAGE OF PROCEEDINGS

CPR 15(1)

CA.05 FEES (MANNER OF PAYMENT)

The manner of payment of the fees indicated in the Summary and in this Chapter
is outlined in Annex CA.I.

CA.06 COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AFTER NATIONAL PHASE ENTRY

notice to submit any of the following: a translation of the abstract, a
translation of the PCT Article 4 request (RO/101), a complete copy of the
claims, description, drawings, or sequence listing that contains translated
text matter and text matter already appearing in English or French, a part of
the application that may be missing, information relating to inventorship and
entitlement or an appointment of a patent agent.

CA.07 APPOINTMENT OF AGENT

CPA 15.1, CPR 27, CPR 28  
An agent may be appointed by submitting to the Commissioner a notice in
accordance with subsection 27(3) of the Canadian Patent Rules.  
If a person, other than a patent agent, submits to the Commissioner a document
appointing a patent agent, other than an associate patent agent, the
appointment is not effective until evidence of the consent to that appointment
by the patent agent who is being appointed is submitted to the Office.

CA.08 MAINTENANCE FEES

CPA 27.1,  CPA 73(1)(c),  CPA 73(3),  CPR 68(1),  CPR 69,  CPR 154(1),  CPR
154(2),  CPR 154(3)  
Maintenance fee payments are due on or before each anniversary of the
international filing date, starting with the second anniversary. Where the
applicant fails to pay by the due date a late payment fee will also be due. A
notice will be sent to the applicant indicating that the maintenance fee and
the late fee must be paid before the later of six months from the maintenance
fee due date or two months from the date of the notice. If the maintenance fee
and the late fee are not paid within the late fee period the application will
be deemed abandoned or, in the case of a patent, the term limited for the
duration of the patent will be deemed to have expired.

An application that is deemed abandoned can be reinstated within 12 months of
the date of abandonment upon payment of the maintenance fee and the late
payment fee together with a request for reinstatement and the reinstatement
fee. The deemed expiry of a patent can be reversed within 12 months after the
end of the six months after the original maintenance fee due date upon payment
of the maintenance fee and the late payment fee, together with a request to
reverse the deemed expired and payment of the additional prescribed fee. In
order to reinstate an abandoned application or reverse the deemed expiry of
the patent (for a patent) the applicant or patentee must also demonstrate that
the failure to pay the maintenance fee and the late fee occurred in spite of
due care required by the circumstances having been taken.

It is to be noted that, where the 30-month time limit under PCT Article 22 or
39(1) and subsections 154(1) and (2) of the Canadian Patent Rules applies, or
where the 30 plus 12-month time limit under PCT Article 22 or 39(1) and
subsection 154(3) applies, a maintenance fee which is or maintenance fees
which are due at an earlier date can be paid without a surcharge up to the
expiry of the 30-month time limit or the 30 plus 12-month time limit,
respectively. The maintenance fees can be paid yearly or for any number of
years in advance. The amount of the maintenance fees is indicated in Annex
CA.I.

the request. Following a request for examination, an examiner will send up to
the maximum of three examiner reports. After the third report is sent, the
applicant will be required to request continued examination. After requesting
continued examination, the examiner will send a maximum of two additional
examiner reports. After the second additional report is sent, the applicant

the application is before 30 October 2019. If the request for examination is
not received within that period, the applicant will be notified. The applicant
has to make a request for examination and pay the late fee before two months
from the date of the notice to avoid abandonment. If the application is deemed
abandoned, it may be reinstated within 12 months of abandonment on payment of
the fee for requesting examination together with the late fee, the request for
reinstatement and the reinstatement fee. If the request for reinstatement is
made after six months from the due date for requesting examination, the
applicant must also demonstrate that the failure to make the request for
examination, pay the fee for examination and pay the late fee occurred in
spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken. The amounts
of the fees are indicated in Annex CA.I.

CA.11 FEE FOR REQUESTING EXAMINATION

CPR 80(1)

(ii) after allowance, but before payment of the final fee, amendments may be
made if, from the specification and the drawings contained in the application
for a patent on the day on which the notice of allowance was sent, it is
obvious that something other than what appears in the specification and the
drawings was intended and that nothing other than the proposed amendment could
have been intended.

(iii) after conditional allowance, when the examiner has allowed the
application subject to certain amendments being made and has informed the
applicant by issuance of a Conditional Notice of Allowance that they are
required to make those amendment or submit arguments as to why the application
complies with the Canadian Patent Act and Rules, the amendments can be made to
address the defects set out in the Conditional Notice of Allowance.
