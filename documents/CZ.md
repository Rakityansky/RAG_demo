three months after the grant of the patent. The annual fees for subsequent
years must be paid not later than the last day in which “the patent year”

The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. If, upon review under PCT Article 25, the Office denies an

from the date of the notification of this decision.

CZ.11 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

CZ.12

PL Art. 65

a time limit may be given only in special cases.

CZ.13

PL. Art. 65  
The Office may excuse a failure to comply with a time limit on legitimate
grounds if a party to the procedure so requests within two months of the day

the omitted act has been performed within that period and that the
administrative fee in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions has
been paid.

CZ.14

proving a priority right or for filing a request for examination of the
application or a request for continuation of the patent procedure may,
likewise, not be excused. Rights acquired by third parties between the date of
expiry of the time limit which has not been complied with and the date on
which the failure to comply was excused shall not be affected.

PCT Art. 4.3,  PCT Art. 43,  PCT Art. 44,  PCT Rule 4.12,  PCT Rule 49
_bis_.1(a),  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(b),  PCT Rule 76.5,  UML Par. 9  
If the applicant wishes to obtain utility model registration in Czechia on the
basis of an international application

(i) instead of a patent, or

(ii) in addition to a patent,

subject to what is said in paragraph 19, the applicant, when performing the
acts referred to in Article 22 or 39, shall so indicate to the Office.

CZ.16

If the international application is for a utility model instead of a patent
(refer to the case referred to in paragraph CZ.15) the requirements are
basically the same as for patents except that the applicant is not required:

(i) to furnish the translation of the abstract,

(ii) to make a request for examination and

(iii) to pay annual fees.

Instead of annual fees, renewal fees become due for utility models. The due
date and amounts are indicated in Annex CZ.I. By payment of the two renewal
fees the term of protection may be extended a first time from five to seven
years and a second time from eight to ten years.

CZ.17

UML Par. 9  
If the international application is for both a utility model and a patent
(refer to the case referred to in paragraph CZ.15(ii), the applicant must,
within the time limit applicable for the entry into the national phase, comply
with the following requirements:

(i) pay two filing fees for both the patent and the utility model,

(ii) furnish the translation into Czech language,

(iii) furnish the translation of international application in three copies for
the patent and in two copies for the utility model,

(iv) file the power of attorney in duplicate.

The requirements (i), (iii) and (iv) may still be complied with within a time
limit fixed in an invitation by the Office, if not already complied with
within the time limit applicable for the entry into the national phase.

PCT Art. 7(2)(ii),  PCT Rule 7.2  
Where, in either of the cases referred to in paragraph CZ.15, the
international application does not contain drawings, the Office will invite
the applicant to furnish drawings within a time limit fixed in the invitation.

CZ.19

UML Par. 10  
A utility model application concerning the subject matter of an earlier
national or international patent application for a national patent for Czechia
may claim the filing date of that earlier patent application provided the
utility model application is filed not later than the expiration of two months
from the date on which the final decision on the patent application is taken
or, if no such decision has been taken, before the end of the tenth year from
the date, of filing of the patent application. Any priority which is claimed
in the earlier patent application will also apply to the subsequent utility
model application.
