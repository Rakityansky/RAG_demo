Does the Office accept the filing of documents by facsimile or the like means
(PCT Rule 92.4)?

Yes, by facsimile

Which kinds of documents may be so transmitted?

All kinds of documents with the exception of authorizations and priority
documents

Must the original of the document be furnished in all cases?

Filing of the international application:  
yes, preferably simultaneously, but in any event not later than one month from
the date of the invitation by the EPO

Other documents:  
only upon invitation by the EPO

Refer to OJ EPO 2007, Special Edition No. 3, page 7 _et seq._

Does the Office send notifications via e-mail in respect of international
applications?

No

Would the Office accept evidence of mailing a document, in case of loss or
delay, where a delivery service other than the postal authorities is used (PCT
Rule 82.1)?

Yes, provided that the delivery service is:  
Chronopost  
DHL  
Federal Express  
Flexpress  
SkyNet  
TNT  
Transworld  
UPS

Does the Office excuse delays in meeting time limits due to the unavailability
of electronic means of communication (PCT Rule 82 _quater_.2(a))?

Yes, delays in meeting time limits could be excused where any of the permitted
means of electronic filing at the EPO notified under Rule 89 _bis_ , or means
of online payment, was unavailable for a minimum of a continuous four-hour
period on a specific working day. Rule 82 _quater_.2 will not be applied by
the EPO if a means of electronic filing is unavailable for less than four
hours and an announcement of the outage has been published at least two
working days in advance. In cases where the advance notice indicated that an
outage was to last for less than four hours, but eventually lasted longer, the
EPO will consider applying Rule 82 _quater_.2. An unplanned outage, however,
does not necessarily have to last a minimum of four hours to qualify for the
application of Rule 82 _quater_.2 by the EPO. If the unavailability of a means
of electronic communication, or means of online payment, is qualified as an
outage by its technical services, the EPO will consider applying Rule 82
_quater_.2

For the relevant notification by the Office refer to the Official Notices (PCT
Gazette) dated 26 November 2020, pages 254 _et seq._ and Notice from the EPO
dated 22 October 2020 concerning the procedures and safeguards which apply
under the EPC and the PCT in the event of outages of means of electronic
filing and other online services (OJ EPO 2020, A120).

Is the Office prepared to allow applicants to make applications available to
the WIPO Digital Access Service for Priority Documents (DAS) (PCT Rule
17.1(b-_bis_)?

Yes, the Office is prepared to allow applicants to make international and
European patent applications available to the WIPO DAS

Types of protection available via the PCT:

European patents

Payment methods accepted by the Office:

Payments to the EPO must be made in euro. Fees due can be paid by:  
a) credit card,  
b) bank transfer or  
c) debiting a deposit account held with the EPO.

a) Payments by credit card must be made via the Central Fee Payment service
available at: <https://fee-payment.epo.org/en/login>, using a credit card
accepted by the EPO (American Express, Master Card and VISA).

b) Payments by bank transfer can be prepared using the Central Fee Payment
service available at: <https://fee-payment.epo.org/en/login>. They must be
made to the following account with the Commerzbank in Germany:  
  
Account No. 3 338 800 00 / Sort code 700 800 00  
IBAN DE20 7008 0000 0333 8800 00  
BIC DRESDEFF700  
Commerzbank AG  
Leopoldstrasse 230  
80807 Munich  
Germany

For information on the Central Fee Payment service, refer to Notice from the
European Patent Office dated 19 July 2022 concerning Central Fee Payment (OJ
EPO 2022, A81).

c) A deposit account may be opened at the request of the prospective account
holder, who must provide all the necessary particulars about their identity,
occupation and address. This is done by completing and submitting the online
request form available on the EPO website under Applying for a patent -> Fees
-> Fee payments and refunds.

Once the deposit account has been opened, its number is communicated to the
holder, who must then make an initial payment commensurate with their
requirements and the intended frequency of replenishment, so as to ensure that
there are sufficient funds in the account. Payments to replenish deposit
accounts must be made in euro into the EPO bank account indicated above
(section b)).  
The account holder must ensure that the account contains sufficient funds at
all times. Debiting occurs only on the basis of an electronic debit order
signed by the account holder or the authorised representative.

The debit order may be:  
— a debit order for individual fees for one or more patent applications, i.e.
a single or a batch debit order, or  
— an automatic debit order for one or more patent applications, authorising
the EPO to debit fees automatically as the proceedings progress.

The debit order must be filed in an electronically processable format (xml)
via one of the following:  
— EPO Online Filing or ePCT using the PCT fee calculation and payment feature,
or  
— Online Filing 2.0 using the PCT fee calculator and payment feature with
Forms PCT/RO/101 and PCT/IPEA/401; or  
— Central Fee Payment.

For further information on the procedure for paying by debiting a deposit
account, refer to Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) and their annexes
(Supplementary publication 2, OJ EPO 2024).

For detailed general information on payment methods accepted by the EPO refer
to "Fee payments and refunds" at:  
<https://www.epo.org/en/applying/fees/payment>

Availability under the national law for an international-type search (PCT
Article 15):

None

separate letter entitled “PCT Direct/informal comments”. If the claims and/or
the description of the international application differ from those of the
earlier application, applicants should preferably also submit a marked-up copy
indicating the differences. PCT Direct submissions are published on
PATENTSCOPE. This service is free of charge.

For more details on the PCT Direct service and, in particular, on the form of
submission and on the content of a PCT Direct request, refer to OJ EPO 2017,

##  Annex L - Deposits of Microorganisms and Other Biological Material

Requirements of designated and elected Offices

Only Offices whose applicable national law contains provisions concerning the
deposits of microorganisms and other biological material are listed in Annex
L. Unless otherwise indicated, deposits may be made for the purposes of patent
procedure before these Offices with any depositary institution having acquired
the status of international depositary authority under the Budapest Treaty on
the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the
Purposes of Patent Procedure.

For a list of these institutions refer to:

<http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/registration/budapest/pdf/idalist.pdf>

Notifications related thereto may be consulted under:

<http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/registration/budapest/>

Further information concerning the requirements of international depository
authorities under the Budapest Treaty is available at:

<http://www.wipo.int/budapest/en/guide/index.html>

Time (if any) earlier than 16 months from priority date by which applicant
must furnish:

— the indications prescribed in Rule 13 _bis_.3(a)(i) to (iii):

None

— any additional indications:

At the time of filing

Additional indications (if any) which must be given besides those prescribed
in Rule 13 _bis_.3(a)(i) to (iii) pursuant to notifications from the Office:

To the extent available to the applicant, relevant information on the
characteristics of the biological material relevant information on the
characteristics of the biological material

Additional information

Deposits with CNCM can be made under the Budapest Treaty or, as far as the
deposits of cell cultures, mycoplasma and rickettsiae are concerned, under a
bilateral agreement with the EPO.

If the applicant wishes that, until the publication of the mention of the
grant of a European patent or for 20 years from the date of filing if the
application is refused or withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, the biological
material shall be made available as provided in Rule 33(1) EPC only by the
issue of a sample to an expert nominated by the requester (Rule 32(1) EPC),
the applicant must, by a written statement, inform the International Bureau
accordingly before completion of technical preparations for publication of the
international application where such publication takes place in one of the EPO
official languages (English, French or German). Such statement must be
separate from the description and the claims of the international application
and must preferably be made on Form PCT/RO/134, referred to in Section 209 of
the Administrative Instructions under the PCT and available on the WIPO
website at <https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/ro/editable/ed_ro134.pdf>.

If the international application was not published in an official language of
the EPO (English, French, German), the statement under Rule 32(1) EPC can
still be submitted in the European phase until completion of the technical
preparations for publication of the translation of the international
application under Article 153(4) EPC. The fact that the expert option has been
chosen will then be published on the front page of the published translation
of the application. Information received under Rule 32(1) EPC after completion
of the technical preparations for publication of the international application
– or, where applicable, of the translation of the application pursuant to
Article 153(4) EPC – cannot be taken into account with the consequence that
the biological material will be available to any person as provided for in PCT
Rule 13 _bis_.6 and Rule 33(1) EPC without an expert acting as intermediary
(refer to Notice from the European Patent Office dated 7 July 2010 concerning
inventions which involve the use of or concern biological material, OJ EPO
10/2010, page 498 _et seq._).

WARNING: Where the invention involves the use of or concerns biological
material which is not available to the public at the date of filing the
application and which has been deposited by a person other than the applicant,
the reference to such a deposit must include the name and address of the
depositor and a statement that the latter has authorized the applicant to
refer to the deposited biological material in the application and has given
his unreserved and irrevocable consent to the deposited material being made
available to the public in accordance with Rule 31(1)(d) of the European
Patent Convention (EPC). If any of these indications (the name and address of
the depositor, and the statement) is not included in a reference to deposited
biological material in the international application as filed, it may still be
furnished to the International Bureau within a period of 16 months after the
date of filing of the international patent application or, if priority is
claimed, after the priority date; this time limit is deemed to have been met
if the indication reaches the International Bureau before the technical
preparations for international publication have been completed (PCT Rule 13
_bis_.4(a)). Where the applicant makes a request for early publication under
PCT Article 21(2)(b), the indications must be furnished to the International
Bureau at the latest before the completion of the technical preparations for
international publication (PCT Rule 13 _bis_.4(c)). The failure to meet this
time limit cannot be remedied upon entry into the European phase neither by
re-establishment of rights nor by further processing. As a result, the
application may have to be refused under Article 97(2) EPC in the course of
examination proceedings for insufficient disclosure (Article 83 EPC).

##  National Phase

##  Summary of requirements for entry into the national phase

Time limits applicable for entry into the national phase:

Under PCT Article 22(3): 31 months from the priority date  
Under PCT Article 39(1)(b): 31 months from the priority date

Does the Office permit reinstatement of rights (PCT Rule 49.6)?

Yes, reinstatement of rights is available in respect of the acts referred to
in Article 22 PCT (payment of the national filing fee and filing the
translation, as required). The EPO applies the “due care” criterion to such
requests. It is noted that this remedy has only advantages if the period for
requesting further processing in respect of these or any other omitted act(s)
required for entering the European phase has already expired. Reference is
made to sections EP.15, EP.25 and EP.26 in respect of the consequences to meet
the time limit(s) for entering the European phase and the applicable legal
remedies.

Translation of international application required into (one of) the following
language(s):

English,

French,

German

Required contents of the translation for entry into the national phase:

Under PCT Article 22: Description, claims (if amended, both as originally
filed and as amended, if the applicant wishes the amendments to form the basis
for the proceedings, together with any statement under PCT Article 19 ), any
text matter of drawings, abstract

Under PCT Article 39(1): Description, claims, any text matter of drawings (if
any of those parts has been amended, both as originally filed and as amended
by the annexes to the international preliminary report on patentability
(Chapter II) and claims amended under PCT Article 19, if the applicant wishes
these amendments to form the basis for the proceedings, together with any
statement under PCT Article 19), abstract

Where the applicant furnishes only one translation of the international
application, or any part of it, either as originally filed or as amended, the
Office will invite the applicant to furnish the missing translation within a
reasonable time limit. If the translation of the amended part or of the
international application as initially filed is missing and is not furnished,
the international application will be considered withdrawn. However, it should
be noted that, if the translation of the claims as amended under PCT Article
19(1) is not furnished in due time, only those claims will be disregarded (PCT
Rule 49.5(c-_bis_)) and the international application will not be considered
withdrawn

Is a copy of the international application required in particular
circumstances?

No

Does the Office accept color drawings under its national law?

Yes, the EPO as designated/elected Office accepts the submission of colour
drawings and photographs. These are, however, converted into black and white
for the purposes of file inspection and publication. As a consequence, details
of colour drawings or photographs may be lost. The EPO is planning to
implement the processing of colour drawings and photographs in the near
future.

##  The procedure in the national Phase

_Detailed information on the procedure before the EPO as designated and
elected Office can also be found in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO,  
Part E, chapter IX, available on the EPO website  
<https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc>_

EP.01 FORM FOR ENTERING THE NATIONAL PHASE

The EPO has available a special form for entering the national phase (EPO Form
1200-refer to Annex EP.II).

The EPO strongly recommends that applicants use the latest version of this
form which contains detailed explanatory notes. The form is also available on
the EPO’s website: <https://www.epo.org/en/applying/forms>. The form may be
filed electronically (using EPO Online Filing (OLF), Online Filing 2.0, the
EPO Web-Form Filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service (Refer to OJ
EPO 2023, A48).

EP.02 LANGUAGE OF PROCEEDINGS

EPC Art. 14, EPC Art. 153(4)  
The language of proceedings is one of the EPO official languages (English,
French or German). If the international application has been published in one
of those languages, this language is the language of proceedings; if not, the
language of the translation which must be submitted upon entry into the
European phase will be the language of the proceedings (refer to paragraph
EP.03). The language of proceedings cannot be changed subsequently.

EPC Rule 3(1), EPC Rule 3(2)  
In written proceedings, the applicant may use any official language of the
EPO. However, amendments (refer to paragraph EP.18) to the application itself
must be filed in the language of the proceedings.

EP.03 TRANSLATION OF THE APPLICATION

EPC Art. 153(4), EPC Rule 159(1)(a), EPC GL, E-IX, 2.1.3, PCT Art. 19(1), PCT
Rule 49.3, PCT Rule 70.16, PCT Rule 74(1)  
If the Euro-PCT application was not published by the International Bureau in
an official language of the EPO (English, French, German), the applicant must,
within the 31-month time limit, submit to the EPO a translation of the
application into one of the official languages (Form 1200, Section 7). In
addition to those elements of the translation which must be furnished within
the time limit of 31 months from the priority date (the description, the
claims and any text in the drawings as originally filed and the abstract as
published), the following elements should also be included:

if the EPO acts as designated Office:

— any amendments made to the claims under PCT Article 19 in the form of a
translation of the complete set of claims furnished in replacement of all
claims originally filed only if the applicant wishes such amendments to form
the basis of further proceedings. The amendments must be submitted together
with, if submitted to the International Bureau, the statement under PCT
Article 19(1) explaining the amendments and, in every case, the accompanying
letter under PCT Rule 46.5(b) in an official language of the EPO. If a
translation of the complete set of claims submitted under PCT Article 19 is
not furnished or not accompanied by a translation of, if submitted to the
International Bureau, the statement under PCT Article 19(1) and, in every
case, the accompanying letter under PCT Rule 46.5(b), the amendments under PCT
Article 19 will be disregarded for the further proceedings. If only the
statement under PCT Article 19(1) is not available in an official language,
only that document will be disregarded;

— any indication under PCT Rule 13 _bis_.3 and 13 _bis_.4, i.e., separately
furnished reference to deposited biological material;

— any nucleotide and amino acid sequence listing under PCT Rule 5.2(a), unless
the text in the sequence listing is available to the EPO in English;

— any request for rectification referred to in PCT Rule 91.3(d) as published
in accordance with PCT Rule 48.2(a)(vii).

if the EPO acts as elected Office:

— translation of any annexes to the international preliminary report on
patentability (Chapter II), i.e. regardless of whether protection is sought
for the same version of the application documents as was the subject of that
report. If any amendments under PCT Article 19 are annexed to the IPRP
(Chapter II), a translation of those amendments must also always be filed.

If the applicant wishes the amendments to the claims made before the IB under
PCT Article 19 to form the basis of the procedure before the EPO as elected
Office, and these amendments are not annexed to the IPRP (Chapter II) (for
instance because they were considered reversed by an amendment under PCT
Article 34), then these amendments must also be furnished in translated form,
as otherwise they will be disregarded for the further proceedings. Any
statement under PCT Article 19(1) and, in every case, the letter under Rule
PCT 46.5(b) must also be furnished in an official language of the EPO. If only
the statement under PCT Article 19(1) is not available in an official
language, only that document will be disregarded.

If the translation of all annexes to the IPRP (Chapter II) is not filed in due
time, the applicant is invited to furnish the missing translation within two
months of notification of a communication. If the applicant fails to comply,
the Euro-PCT application is deemed to be withdrawn. The applicant may request
further processing (or re-establishment of rights under PCT Rule 49.6 if the
application is deemed withdrawn because the translation was not filed in due
time. However, the fee is higher and stricter requirements apply. Therefore,
this remedy has only advantages if the period for requesting further
processing has already expired).

EP.04 TRANSLATION (CORRECTION)

Errors in the translation of the international application can be corrected
with reference to the text of the international application as filed (refer to
National Phase, paragraphs 6.002 and 6.003).

EP.05 FEES (METHOD OF PAYMENT)

RFees Art. 5  
The method of payment of the fees indicated in the Summary and in this Chapter
is outlined in Annex EP.I. Payments via a deposit account held with the EPO
are only accepted if made online, i.e. in an electronically processable format
(XML), using, e.g. the electronic EPO filing forms or the Central Fee Payment
service (refer to OJ EPO 2022, A81). This also applies to automatic debit
orders. Furthermore, any refund instructions to a deposit account must also be
filed in an electronic processable format. For more details, refer to the
Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) and their annexes in Annex EP.I and
the Supplementary publication 2 to OJ EPO 2024 (also refer to Annex EP.I).

EP.05a FILING FEE

PCT Art. 22(1), PCT Art. 39(1), EPC Art. 78(2), EPC Rule 159(1)(c), EPC Rule
165, RFees Art. 2(1).1, OJ EPO 2009-118  
Within the 31-month time limit the European filing fee must be paid. This fee
is composed of a basic fee and an additional fee which is due for the 36th and
each subsequent page of the application. The additional fee is referred to as
the “page fee”. The basic fee is reduced where EPO Form 1200 is filed via EPO
Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0, the EPO Web-Form Filing service or the EPO
Contingency Upload Service. If the basic filing fee and/or, where applicable,
the page fee, is not paid in full in due time, the application will be deemed
withdrawn. In addition, the Euro-PCT application will not be considered as
comprised in the state of the art under EPC Article 54(3).

EP.05b PAGE FEE

EPC Rule 38(2), RFees Art. 2(1).1a, OJ EPO 2009-338  
As a general rule, the page fee is based on the international application as
published, regardless of the language of publication. The pages of the
description, claims and drawings are counted, plus one page in total for any
pages with the bibliographic data and the abstract. Amended claims under PCT
Article 19 and/or PCT Article 34 are also considered part of the international
publication and must be taken into account unless the applicant has indicated
that the procedure in the European phase is not to be based on them. If (parts
of) the description and/or claims are amended on entry into the European
phase, the amended pages of the description and the amended set of claims
replace the equivalent pages of the international application as published
and, consequently, form then the basis for calculating the page fee.

However, the calculation of the page fee cannot be based on pages of the
description or of the claims drafted partly in an official language of the EPO
and partly in another language. Thus, special rules for calculating the page
fee apply if the international application was not published in one of the
official languages of the EPO and amendments are filed upon entry into the
European phase. Detailed information regarding the correct calculation of the
page fee in such case is provided in OJ EPO 2009-338 and in the Guidelines for
Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2. Completion of section 6 of EPO Form 1200
and the related table serves applicants to clearly indicate to the EPO the
documents on which the further proceedings are to be based and to correctly
compute the page fee.

Pages with amendments filed after expiry of the 31-month time limit are not
taken into account in calculating the page fee. Furthermore, page fees will
not be refunded if the number of pages is reduced during the proceedings
before the EPO.

EP.06 EUROPEAN DESIGNATION FEE

EPC Art. 79(2), EPC Rule 159(1)(d), EPC Rule 160, EPC Rule 39(1), RFees Art. 2
No. 3  
A (flat) designation fee must be paid within six months from the publication
by the International Bureau of the international search report or before the
expiration of the time limit applicable under PCT Articles 22(3) and 39(1)(b)
and EPC Rule 159 (31 months from the filing date or, if priority has been
claimed, the earliest priority date), whichever time limit expires later. If
the designation fee is not paid in due time, the Euro-PCT application will be
deemed withdrawn.

EP.07 EXTENSION/VALIDATION

OJ EPO 2009-603, OJ EPO 2015-A18-20, OJ EPO 2015-A84, OJ EPO 2015-A85, OJ EPO
2016-A5, OJ EPO 2016-A67, OJ EPO 2017-A85, OJ EPO 2018-A16, OJ EPO 2023, A105  
International applications entering into the national phase at the EPO
(European phase) can be extended to or validated in certain States which have
concluded an Extension or Validation Agreement to that effect with the
European Patent Organisation (they are indicated in the Summary), provided the
Extension/Validation Agreement with the EPO was in force at the international
filing date, the State concerned was designated for a national patent in the
international application and the respective extension/validation fees have
been paid, the amount of which is indicated in Annex EP.I. For payment of the
extension/validation fee, the provisions for payment of the European
designation fees apply _mutatis mutandis_. The request for
extension/validation for a state is deemed withdrawn if the
extension/validation fee is not paid to the EPO within the time limit laid
down in the EPC for the payment of the designation fee (EPC Rule 159(1)(d) and
EPC Rule 39(1), refer to paragraph EP.06). If the designation fee was paid but
none of the extension/validation fees, no communication pointing out the
failure to observe the time limit for payment of the extension/validation fees
is issued. However, the applicant may still pay an extension/validation fee
after expiry of the (basic) time limit for payment of the designation fee and
the extension/validation fees with a 50% surcharge within a grace period of
two months as from expiry of the basic time limit. Furthermore, where in the
absence of payment of the designation fee in due time further processing can
be requested in respect of the designation fee, the applicant may within two
months from notification of the communication of the loss of rights also pay
the extension/validation fee(s) with a 50% surcharge (refer to Guidelines for
Examination in the EPO, A-III, 12.2). When an extension State accedes to the
EPC, the Extension Agreement remains applicable to international applications
filed prior to the date of accession.

EP.08 CLAIMS FEES

EPC Rule 162  
If the application documents on which the European grant procedure is to be
based contain more than fifteen claims, a claims fee is payable within the
31-month period in respect of the sixteenth and each subsequent claim. A
higher claims fee is payable in respect of the 51st and each subsequent claim.
The claims fees must be calculated on the basis of the number of claims
specified to form the basis for the further proceedings on entry into the
national phase (that is, where amendments have been filed, the claims as
amended under PCT Article 19 or 34(2) or the claims as submitted by the
applicant under PCT Article 28 or 41 upon entering the national phase), unless
the applicant uses the opportunity to amend the claims in response to the
communication pursuant to EPC Rules 161 and 162 referred to in paragraph
EP.18, the claims thus amended being then used as the basis for calculation of
the claims fee and for the further proceedings. Where the applicant fails to
pay the correct amount of the claims fees within the 31-month time limit, the
EPO will invite him to pay the missing amount within the non-extendable six-
month time limit set in the communication under EPC Rules 161 and 162. Where
the number of claims changes as a consequence of a later (further) amendment
filed in response to the communication pursuant to Rules 161 and 162, that
number is to be used as the basis for calculating the amount of the claims
fees to be paid. Where a claim fee is not paid in due time, a noting of loss
of rights (EPC Rule 112(1)) is issued, giving the applicant the opportunity to
request further processing (EPC Article 121) by paying the missing claims
fee(s) together with the applicable fee for further processing within a period
of two months from notification of the communication. If not paid within that
period, the claim(s) concerned shall be deemed to be abandoned. Features of a
claim deemed to have been abandoned and which are not otherwise to be found in
the description or drawings cannot subsequently be reintroduced into the
application and, in particular, the claims.

EP.09 DESIGNATION OF THE INVENTOR

EPC Rule 163(1), EPC Rule 163(6), OJ EPO 2021-A12, OJ EPO 2021-A3  
A designation of inventor must only be filed upon entry into the European
phase if within the 31-month time limit the inventor has not been designated
or certain information, e.g. the country or place of residence, is missing. If
not filed upon entry, the EPO will invite the applicant to file the missing
information within two months from the notification of a communication under
Rule 163(1) or (4) EPC. If the missing information is not furnished within the
two-month time limit, the application is refused. For further details, refer
to the form for such designation in Annex EP.III. Legalization is not
required.

EP.10 APPOINTMENT OF AN AGENT AND POWER OF ATTORNEY

EPC Art. 133, EPC Art. 134, EPC Rule 152, EPC Rule 163(5), EPC Rule 163(6), OJ
EPO 2007, Special Edition No. 3, page 128 _et seq._  
Natural and legal persons having either their residence or their principal
place of business within the territory of one of the EPC contracting states
may act on their own behalf in proceedings before the EPO (EPC Article
133(1)). Natural and legal persons not having either a residence or their
principal place of business within the territory of one of the EPC contracting
states must be represented by a professional representative and act through
them in all proceedings established by the EPC (refer to the Summary, “Who can
act as agent?”). In case of failure to appoint the required professional
representative, the applicant will be invited by the EPO to do so within two
months. If the deficiency is not corrected in due time, the application is
refused. Nevertheless, the applicant may act on their own behalf within the
31-month time limit applicable under PCT Articles 22(3) and 39(1)(b) and EPC
Rule 159(1). Under no circumstances, however, may the applicant act through
the agent appointed during the international phase if the latter is not an
agent entitled to practice before the EPO. Payments can be made by anybody. A
power of attorney (“Authorisation” or “General Authorisation”, refer to
samples given in Annexes EP.IV and EP.V, respectively), generally, need not be
filed by an agent who is a professional representative entered on the list
maintained by the EPO. It is, however, necessary that they inform the EPO of
their appointment. This applies even if the professional representative was
appointed for the international phase, unless they were at the same time also
explicitly appointed for the European phase before the EPO acting as Receiving
Office. Legal practitioners entitled to practice before the EPO and employees
representing an applicant under EPC Article 133(3) who are not professional
representatives must always file a signed authorization or a reference to a
general authorization already on file (for details, refer to the Decision of
the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007 on the filing of authorizations,
OJ EPO 2007, Special edition No. 3, 128 _et seq._). Only where the EPO acted
as receiving Office and the authorization expressly empowered the legal
practitioner or employee to act before the EPO in the national phase, is a new
authorization not required. In the cases where a power of attorney is
required, the EPO will invite the applicant or agent to file it within a
period to be specified. If the authorization is not filed in due time, any
procedural steps taken by the agent will be deemed not to have been taken.

EP.11 RENEWAL FEES

EPC Art. 86(1), EPC Art. 86(2), EPC Rule 159(1)(g), EPC Rule 51, OJ EPO
2018-A2, RFees Art. 2 No. 4, RFees Art. 2 No. 5  
They are payable for the third and each subsequent year following the
international filing date. Payment must be made before the expiration of the
month containing the anniversary of the international filing date. Payment can
then still be made, together with a 50% surcharge for late payment, before the
expiration of the sixth month after the month containing the anniversary of
the international filing date. It is to be noted that a renewal fee which is
due within the 31-month time limit applicable under PCT Articles 22(3) and
39(1)(b) can be paid without surcharge up to the expiration of the 31-month
time limit. The renewal fee can still validly be paid within six months after
the expiration of the 31-month time limit, subject to the payment of the 50%
surcharge. If the renewal fee is not paid within the six-month period, the
application is deemed to be withdrawn. The failure to meet the time limit for
paying the renewal fee with surcharge may be remedied by filing a request for
re-establishment of rights (EPC Article 122, EPC Rule 136). The amounts of the
renewal fees are indicated in Annex EP.I. For the calculation of aggregate
time limits, refer to OJ EPO 1993-229, point II-3. The renewal fee in respect
of the third year may not be validly paid more than six months before it falls
due. All other renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months
before they fall due.

EP.12 REQUEST FOR EXAMINATION

EPC Art. 94  
A European patent will be granted only if the substantive examination of the
application shows it to meet the requirements of the EPC. Examination will
only start upon explicit request. The request may be made by using the form
referred to in paragraph EP.01 (refer to pre-crossed box 4.1 of EPO Form 1200,
Annex EP.II). The request for examination is not deemed to be filed until
after the examination fee has been paid.

EP.13 TIME LIMIT FOR REQUESTING EXAMINATION

EPC Rule 159(1)(f), EPC Rule 160(1), EPC Rule 70(1)  
Examination must be requested within six months from the publication by the
International Bureau of the international search report or before the
expiration of the time limit applicable under PCT Articles 22(3) and 39(1)(b)
and EPC Rule 159(1) (31 months from the filing date or, if priority has been
claimed, from the earliest priority date), whichever time limit expires later.
If the request for examination is not filed or the examination fee (refer to
paragraph EP.14) not paid in due time, the Euro-PCT application is deemed to
be withdrawn.

EP.14 FEE FOR EXAMINATION

EPC Art. 94(1), RFees Art. 14(2)  
The request for examination is only effective if the examination fee has been
paid. That fee must therefore be paid within the time limits set out in
paragraph EP.13. The amount of the said fee is indicated in Annex EP.I.

(i) It is reduced by 75% where an international preliminary report on
patentability (Chapter II) has been established by the EPO. If the report was
established on certain parts of the international application, the reduction
is allowed only if examination is to be performed on subject matter covered by
the report.

EPC Art. 14(2), EPC Rule 7a(1), EPC Rule 7a(2), EPC Rule 7b(1), OJ EPO 2024,
A8, RFees Art. 14(1)  
(ii) Furthermore, a 30% reduction in the examination fee is available to
microenterprises, natural persons, non-profit organizations, universities or
public research organizations having their residence or principal place of
business in a EPC contracting state with an official language other than
English, French or German if they file the request for examination in an
official language of that state (“admissible non-EPO language”) and declare
themselves to be entitled to do so (EPC Rule 7b(1)). The declaration may be
made directly in EPO Form 1200 or using EPO Form 1011. Since the request for
examination is only effective if the examination fee has been paid, the
request for examination in an admissible non-EPO language may still be filed
up until the examination fee is paid. If the request for examination in an
admissible non-EPO language is filed subsequently, it must be accompanied by a
translation of the request for examination in the procedural language. (Refer
to Annex EP.II, EPO Form 1200, page 2, box 4).

RFees Art. 11, OJ EPO 2013-153  
(iii) If the conditions for both reductions are fulfilled, the examination fee
is first reduced by 75%. The 30% reduction is applied to the resulting total
and not to the full fee. Therefore, the total reduction in relation to the
full fee is 82.50%.

OJ EPO 2016-A48, OJ EPO 2016-A49, RFees Art. 11(a), RFees Art. 11(b)  
The examination fee is refunded in full if the application is withdrawn,
refused or deemed to be withdrawn before substantive examination has begun.
Fifty percent of the examination fee is refunded if the application is
withdrawn, refused or deemed to be withdrawn after the examining division has
begun but before expiry of the time limit for replying to the first invitation
under Article 94(3) EPC issued by the examining division, or if no such
invitation has been issued, before the date of the communication under Rule
71(3) EPC.

EP.14a FEE REDUCTIONS FOR MICROENTERPRISES, NATURAL PERSONS, NON-PROFIT
ORGANISATIONS, UNIVERSITIES OR PUBLIC RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS

The following fees shall be reduced by 30% where an applicant declares to be a
microenterprise, natural person, non-profit organisation, university or public
research organisation files a European patent application or, in respect of an
international application, performs the acts referred to in Rule 159:  
(a) filing fee;  
(b) fee for a European or supplementary European search;  
(c) examination fee, and in addition the previously paid international search
fee where the European Patent Office acted as International Searching
Authority;  
(d) designation fee;  
(e) fee for grant;  
(f) renewal fees for the European patent application. 7

provided, the same applicant(s) has/have not filed five or more applications
(EP or Euro-PCT) in the five preceding years (EPC Rule 7a(4)). If there are
multiple applicants, each of them must fulfil the applicable eligibility
criteria. The declaration under EPC Rule 7b(1) can be made directly in EPO
Form 1200 or using EPO Form 1011. 7

EP.15 CONSEQUENCES OF NON-FULFILMENT OF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS

EPC Art. 121, EPC Rule 135, EPC Rule 160  
EPC Rule 160 provides that if either the translation of the international
application or the request for examination is not filed in due time or if the
filing fee, including any additional fee for pages exceeding 35, the search
fee, the examination fee or the designation fee is not paid in due time, the
European patent application is deemed withdrawn. In these circumstances, the
applicant will be informed of the deemed withdrawal and EPC Rule 112(2) shall
apply. However, the loss of rights shall be deemed not to have occurred if,
within two months of the EPO notification, further processing is requested by
payment of the respective fee(s) for further processing and the omitted act is
completed.

If the applicant neither filed the request for examination nor paid the
examination fee in due time, further processing must be requested in respect
of both omissions, i.e. in respect of filing the request for examination and
payment of the examination fee. It follows that the applicant must file the
request for examination and pay the examination fee together with two fees for
further processing: a flat fee for further processing in respect of the
request for examination and 50% of the examination fee.

EP.16a SUPPLEMENTARY EUROPEAN SEARCH

EPC Art. 153(7), EPC Rule 161, EPC Rule 70(2), EPC Rule 70a(2)  
As a rule, a supplementary European search must be performed for each
international application entering the European phase and a search fee must be
paid.

The supplementary European search will be based on the last set of (amended)
claims available to the EPO on the date of expiry of the time limit set under
EPC Rule 161(2). Thus, any amendment to the claims which has been filed up to
that date will be taken into account (refer to paragraph EP.18).

OJ EPO 2015-A94  
Where the request for examination was filed before transmittal of the
supplementary European search report, which is usually the case, the EPO
invites the applicant, after transmittal of the supplementary European search
report, to indicate whether they wish to proceed further with the application
before the EPO. The applicant may waive the right to receive such
communication by informing the EPO thereof in due time.

— If the applicant does not wish to proceed further, they may withdraw the
application or they may simply refrain from answering the invitation within
the time limit fixed in it and the application is deemed to be withdrawn. If
the applicant wishes to proceed further, they must notify the EPO accordingly.
They may, at the same time, respond to the supplementary European search
report by filing amendments and/or comments on the application. The applicant
is required to reply to a search opinion within the time limit set by the EPO
in its communication under EPC Rule 70a(2) if the EPO has issued a negative
written opinion (refer to Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8 and
EP.18).

No supplementary European search performed:

Dispensation applies and no search fee is to be paid if the international
search report (or supplementary international search report) was established
by the EPO. In this case the applicant will be invited to comment on the
written opinion of the ISA or on the IPRP (Chapter II), or on the
supplementary international search report and to correct, if appropriate, any
deficiencies noted therein and to amend the application within six months from
notification of the invitation (EPC Rule 161(1)); refer to Guidelines for
Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.2 for more details. 19 20

EP.16b SEARCH FEE

If a supplementary European search report is to be established, the search fee
must be paid within the 31-month time limit, and may be reduced as follows:

OJ EPO 2024-A3  
by EUR 1,300 where the international search report was drawn up by the
Austrian Patent Office, the Finnish Patent and Registration Office, the Nordic
Patent Institute, the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office, the Swedish
Intellectual Property Office (PRV), the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office
(Turkpatent) or the Visegrad Patent Institute. This reduction also applies
when a supplementary international search was established by the Austrian
Patent Office, the Finnish Patent and Registration Office, the Nordic Patent
Institute, the Swedish Intellectual Property Office (PRV), the Turkish Patent
and Trademark Office (Turkpatent) or the Visegrad Patent Institute.

OJ EPO 2024, A6  
If the application claims the priority of an earlier application for which a
search was carried out by the EPO, (a part of) the fee paid for the
supplementary European search may be refunded. The level of any refund depends
on the type of the earlier search and the extent to which the EPO benefits
from the earlier search report when carrying out the supplementary search.

EP.17 NUCLEOTIDE AND AMINO ACID SEQUENCES

EPC Rule 30, EPC Rule 163(3), OJ EPO 2021, A96, OJ EPO 2021, A97  
If a Standard-compliant sequence listing is contained in the international
application under PCT Rule 5.2, furnished to the EPO acting as ISA/SISA or
IPEA under PCT Rule 13 _ter_.1(a) or made accessible to the EPO by other
means, the applicant does not have to submit the Standard-compliant sequence
listing again on entry into the regional phase before the EPO as designated or
elected Office.

Where, however, a Standard-compliant sequence listing is not available to the
EPO on the expiry of the period under Rule 159(1) EPC, the applicant will be
invited to file a Standard-compliant sequence listing within a non-extendable
period of two months from the invitation and to pay the late furnishing fee.
Furthermore, the applicant must enclose, together with the late filed sequence
listing, a declaration to the effect that the sequence listing does not extend
beyond the content of the application as originally filed (refer to EPO Form
1200, Section 9.2). The sequence listing must not be submitted on paper or in
PDF format. EPC Rule 30(2) and (3) and the Decision of the President of the
European Patent Office dated 9 December 2021 on the filing of sequence
listings (OJ EPO 2021, A96) are to be applied accordingly (refer to EPC Rule
163(3) in conjunction with Article 5 of the above-mentioned decision of the
President).

If any deficiencies are not remedied in due time after such an invitation –
this also applies to the payment of the late furnishing fee – the application
will be refused (EPC Rule 30(3)). The applicant may request further processing
of the application under EPC Article 121 EPC. For international and European
patent applications filed until 30 June 2022, WIPO Standard ST.25 is
applicable. 21

For international and European patent applications filed on or after 1 July
2022, the applicable sequence listing standard is WIPO Standard ST.26 (refer
to the Decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021 on the
filing of sequence listings, OJ EPO 2021, A96 and the corresponding notice, OJ
EPO 2021, A97).

EP.18 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION; TIME LIMITS

EPC Rule 161(1), EPC Rule 161(2), OJ EPO 2010-634  
For the purpose of the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office
the applicant may always file (voluntary) amendments within the 31-month time
limit, and if may file (further) amendments until expiry of the time limit set
in the combined communication under EPC Rules 161 and 162. The applicant may
also be required to file (mandatory) amendments to and/or comments on the
application within the time limit set in the communication under EPC Rules 161
and 162. Whether or not a response is mandatory is clearly stated in the
communication, its wording thus differing depending on the case (EPO Forms
1226AA, 1226BB or 1226CC).

The communication under EPC Rules 161 and 162 is issued for each application
promptly once the application has entered the European phase and on condition
that the ISR is available to the EPO. This means that it is also issued if the
applicant has already filed, with Form 1200 or thereafter, amendments and/or
comments to form the basis for the procedure in the European phase. Pursuant
to EPC Rules 161 and 162 the time limit set in the communication is six
months. This time limit cannot be extended.

OJ EPO 2015-A94  
In order to accelerate the grant procedure the applicant can waive their right
to the Rule 161/162 communication by crossing the box in Section 12.2, first
checkbox, of EPO Form 1200. The waiver will only be effective if any claims
fees due for the set of claims indicated as the basis for the procedure in the
European phase have been paid and any mandatory substantive response to the
WO-ISA / the IPRP (Chapter II) / the SISR, established by the EPO, was filed
on entry into the European phase.

EPC Rule 70a(2),  EPC Rule 70a(3),  EPC Rule 137(3)  
After expiry of the six-month time limit further possibilities for amending
the application are limited. If no supplementary European search is carried
out, it is at the discretion of the examining division to allow amendments. If
a supplementary European search is carried out, the applicant always has one
further opportunity to submit amendments upon receipt of the report. Thus,
after issuance of the supplementary European search report the applicant may,
first of all, comment on both the report and the search opinion and file
(voluntary) amendments to the description, claims and drawings within the
period specified in the communication under EPC Rule 70a(2) for indicating
whether they wish to proceed further with the application. Secondly, if any
deficiencies are noted in the search opinion, the applicant will be required
under EPC Rule 70a(2) to respond to the objections made. The application will
be deemed withdrawn if the applicant does not submit a substantive reply to
the communication under EPC Rule 70a(2) (“mandatory response”). The loss of
rights can be remedied by requesting further processing. Amendments made
thereafter require the consent of the examining division.

EPC Art. 123(2)  
Amendments may under no circumstances go beyond the disclosure in the
international application as filed.

EPC Rule 137(4)  
Whenever amendments are filed, the applicant must identify them and indicate
their basis in the application as filed. If they fail to do so, the examining
division may issue a communication requesting correction of the omission
within a non-extendable time limit of one month. If the deficiency is not
remedied in due time, the application will be deemed withdrawn under EPC
Article 94(4). The loss of rights can be remedied by requesting further
processing.

EP.19 GRANTING OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT

EPC Art. 97(1), EPC Rule 71(3), EPC Rule 71(4), EPC Rule 71(5), EPC Rule 71(6)  
Prior to the decision to grant the European patent, the applicant will receive
a communication containing both the text in which the Examining Division
intends to grant the European patent and an invitation to pay the grant and
printing fees and to supply a translation of the claims in the two other
official languages of the EPO. Performance of these acts implies approval of
the text. If applicable, the communication will also include an invitation to
pay additional claims fees.

EP.20 FEE FOR GRANT, INCLUDING FEE FOR PUBLISHING AND CLAIMS FEE

EPC Rule 71(3)  
The amounts of the fees are indicated in Annex EP.I. They must be paid within
four months from the communication pursuant to EPC Rule 71(3) referred to in
paragraph EP.19

EP.21 TRANSLATION OF CLAIMS

EPC Rule 71(3)  
Within the same period, the claims must be translated into the two official
languages of the EPO which are not the language of proceedings (refer to
paragraphs EP.02 and EP.19).

EP.22 EARLY PROCESSING OF NATIONAL PHASE

EPC Rule 159(1), PCT Art. 23(2), PCT Art. 40(2)  
If the applicant wishes the processing and the examination of the application
to start earlier than the expiration of the time limit applicable under PCT
Article 22(3) or 39(1)(b), they must file an express request for early
processing. The request can be made by ticking the checkbox in section 12.1 of
EPO Form 1200. Moreover, the applicant must fulfill the requirements for entry
into the European phase as if the 31-month time limit provided for in EPC Rule
159(1) expired on the date they request early processing (refer to OJ EPO No.
3/2013-156 _et seq._).

EP.23 REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 25 OF THE PCT

PCT Art. 25, PCT Rule 51, PCT Rule 82 _bis_ , EPC Rule 159(2)  
The applicable procedure is outlined in paragraphs 6.018 to 6.021 of the
National Phase. At the request of the applicant, the EPO may review whether a
refusal by the receiving Office to accord a filing date, or a declaration on
the part of the receiving Office that a Euro-PCT application or the
designation of a state is considered withdrawn, or a finding by the
International Bureau under PCT Article 12(3) is the result of an error or
omission on the part of the authority concerned, in which case the Euro-PCT
application can proceed as a European application.

To obtain such a review by the EPO as designated/elected Office, applicants
must, within the two-month time limit under PCT Rule 51.1, request the
International Bureau under PCT Article 25(1) to send copies of documents in
the files promptly to the EPO as designated Office. Furthermore, the filing
fee under EPC Rule 159(1)(c) must be paid and, where required, a translation
of the Euro-PCT application furnished within the same two-month time limit
(PCT Rule 51.3).

Applicants are recommended to undertake the remaining steps for entry into the
European phase under EPC Rule 159(1) at the same time.

EPC Art. 106,  EPC Art. 108  
If, upon review under PCT Article 25, the EPO denies an error or omission on
the part of the receiving Office or the International Bureau, a notice of
appeal against this decision may be lodged within two months from the date of
receipt of the decision. Within the same two-month time limit, a fee for
appeal must be paid (for the amount, refer to Annex EP.I). Within four months
from the date of receipt of the decision, grounds substantiating the notice of
appeal must be filed. The Board of Appeal will then decide on the appeal.

EP.24 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2), PCT Art. 48(2), PCT Rule 82 _bis_  
Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.028 of the National Phase and to
paragraph EP.15.

EP.25 FURTHER PROCESSING

PCT Rule 82 _bis_.2,  EPC Art. 121,  EPC Rule 135  
Further processing of the application may be requested where the applicant has
missed a time limit during the international or the national phase in respect
of which further processing is not ruled out under Rule 135(2). If the request
is granted, this has the effect that the legal consequence of the failure to
observe the time limit is deemed not to have ensued. It must be made by
completing the omitted act(s), as applicable, and payment of the fee(s) for
further processing, the amount of which is indicated in Annex EP.I, within two
months of the notification of the noting of loss of rights (EPC Rule 112(1)).
The fee for further processing varies depending on whether the loss of rights
occurred due to an omitted act (flat rate fee) or the late payment of a fee
(50% of that fee). In some cases, both fees for further processing have to be
paid, e.g. if further processing is requested for the late filing of the
request for examination and the late payment of the examination fee (refer to
paragraph EP.15).

EP.26 RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHTS

PCT Rule 82 _bis_.2,  EPC Art. 122,  EPC Rule 136  
Re-establishment of rights may be requested where the applicant lost any right
because, in spite of all due care required by the circumstances having been
taken, they were unable to observe a time limit during the international or
the national phase. An application for re-establishment must be filed in
writing within two months from the removal of the cause of non-compliance with
the time limit(s) but not later than one year from the expiration of the time
limit(s) which have not been observed. Within the said two months, the omitted
act(s) must be completed, the respective fee(s) for re-establishment of rights
(refer to Annex EP.I) must be paid and the request must state the grounds on
which it is based and must set out the facts on which it relies. However, re-
establishment of rights is ruled out in respect of any period for which
further processing under EPC Article 121 is available. Refer to Guidelines for
Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3 for more details.

EP.27 PRIORITY DOCUMENTS

EPC Rule 53(2), OJ EPO 2019-A27, OJ EPO 2021-A83  
Where the priority of an earlier application is claimed for a Euro-PCT
application, the priority document is sent by the International Bureau to the
EPO, if the International Bureau received the priority document from the
receiving Office or directly from the applicant or was able to retrieve it
from a digital library. The EPO will, at the request of the applicant, include
free of charge in the file of the European patent application a copy of the
previous application from which priority is claimed, if it can be retrieved
via the WIPO Digital Access Service (DAS), using the indicated DAS access
code. Where for any reason the priority document has not been submitted by the
time of entry into the national phase, the applicant will be invited to
furnish the missing document(s) within two months from the date of a
notification under EPC Rule 163(2). This time limit cannot be extended. If the
priority document or the application number is not submitted within that time
limit, the priority right is lost. The loss of rights may be remedied by
requesting further processing.

EPC Rule 163(2), OJ EPO 2023, A48  
A priority document may be filed in electronic form with the EPO only if it is
digitally signed by the issuing authority and the signature is accepted by the
EPO. A priority document cannot be filed by fax, Web-Form Filing or the EPO
Contingency Upload Service.

No obligation to furnish the priority document:

The EPO as designated/elected Office will include a copy of the priority
document free of charge in the file of a Euro-PCT application even without
having received a copy from the International Bureau if the priority
application is:

— a European patent application;

— an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office;

EPC Rule 53(3)  
Where the language of priority documents is not one of the official languages
of the EPO (English, French or German) and the validity of the priority claim
is relevant to the determination of the patentability of the invention
concerned, the applicant is invited to file, within the time limit specified
by the EPO, a translation in one of these three languages or a declaration
that the international application is a complete translation of the priority
application. Failure to comply with this invitation will result in the loss of
the right of the relevant priority. For further information refer to
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.

EP.28 RESTORATION OF PRIORITY

EPC Art. 122, OJ EPO 2007-692, PCT Rule 49 _ter_.1, PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2  
If the international application was filed more than 12 months from the filing
date of the earlier application whose priority is claimed, the applicant may
file or resubmit a request for restoration of priority with the EPO as
designated/elected Office.

A request for restoration of the right of priority under PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2
may be granted provided the following requirements are met:

— the filing date is within two months from the date on which the priority
period expired (PCT Rule 26 _bis_.2(c)(iii));

— the failure to claim the right of priority within the priority period
occurred in spite of all due care required by the circumstances having been
taken; thus, the requirement of due care is applied by the EPO in accordance
with its standing practice under EPC Article 122;

— the request for restoration of priority is filed within one month from the
date on which the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase
expired (PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2(b)(i)), or within one month from the receipt of a
request for early processing (PCT Articles 23(2) or 40(2));

— the fee for restoration of priority levied by the EPO is duly paid within
the same time limit (PCT Rule 49 _ter_.2(b)(iii));

— the request for restoration of priority is accompanied by a statement of
reasons for the failure and is preferably accompanied by any declaration or
other evidence in support of the statement of reasons (PCT Rule 49
_ter_.2(b)(ii)).

EP.29 PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO CLAIM PIORITY

EPC Art. 87(1)  
The applicant claiming the priority from a previous application must be the
applicant of the latter or the successor in title to the applicant who filed
the previous application. Where the previous application was filed by joint
applicants, all of them must be among the later international or European
patent application’s applicants or have transferred their rights in the
priority application to the later patent application’s applicant. However, the
EPC does not set out any formal requirements for the transfer of the priority
right. Absent any substantiated indication to the contrary, there is a strong
presumption under the EPC that an applicant or joint applicants claiming
priority in accordance with EPC Art. 88(1) and EPC Rule 52 are entitled to the
claimed priority. Where an international application under the PCT is filed by
joint applicants, including the priority applicant, but without naming the
priority applicant as applicant for the European designation, the mere fact of
the joint filing implies an agreement between the applicants allowing all of
them to rely on the priority right unless substantial facts indicate otherwise
(Refer to G 1/22 and G 2/22).

EP.30 LACK OF UNITY

EPC Art. 82, EPC Rule 164, OJ EPO 2014-A70  
If upon expiry of the time limit set in the communication under EPC Rules 161
and 162 for filing amendments, the documents that serve as the basis for the
supplementary European search or for examination contain claims relating to an
invention that was not searched by the EPO, and the application documents do
not meet the requirement of unity of invention, the procedure under EPC Rule
164 applies (refer to OJ EPO 2014-A70).

The EPO did not act as (S)ISA:

— In this case the EPO draws up a partial supplementary European search report
on those parts of the application which relate to the invention first
mentioned in the claims and informs the applicant that, for the supplementary
European search report to cover the other inventions, a further search fee
must be paid in respect of each invention involved, within two months.

The EPO acted as (S)ISA:

— Where the supplementary European search report is dispensed with (refer to
EP.16a) and the examining division considers that in the application documents
which are to serve as the basis for examination an invention is claimed which
was not searched by the EPO as (S)ISA, the examining division shall inform the
applicant that a search will be performed in respect of any such invention for
which a search fee is paid within a period of two months.

EP.31 INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF CORRECT ELEMENTS OR PARTS UNDER PCT RULE
20.5 _bis_(d)

OJ EPO 2020-A81, OJ EPO 2022, A71, PCT Rule 20.5 _bis_(d), PCT Rule
20.8(b-_bis_)  
In the international phase, under PCT Rule 20.5 _bis_(d), it is possible to
incorporate by reference correct elements or parts into the application as
originally filed without changing the international filing date, provided the
requirements of PCT Rule 20.5 _bis_(d) are fulfilled. However, where the
international application was filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022
and the receiving Office has allowed the incorporation of correct elements or
parts, such incorporation will not be effective before the EPO as designated
or elected Office due to the incompatibility of PCT Rule 20.5 _bis_(d) with
the EPC (refer to “International Phase”, paragraph 6.027).

In such cases, applicants may inform the EPO within the 31-month time limit
under EPC Rule 159(1), or at the latest before a corresponding communication
is issued, on the basis of which documents they wish to pursue the Euro-PCT
application:

a) on documents containing the correct elements or parts and with the filing
date changed to the date of receipt of those elements or parts, or

b) on the documents as originally filed and based on the initial filing date.
In such case, the correct elements or parts incorporated by reference are
disregarded.

If no such information is present on entry into the European phase, the EPO
will send a communication under PCT Rule 20.8(c) and Rule 82 _ter_.1(c) and
(d) to clarify the situation for the proceedings before the EPO as designated
or elected Office.

For international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022, the EPO will
fully apply Rule 20.5 _bis_ PCT, so that incorporations by reference allowed
by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5 _bis_(d) PCT will also be effective
before the EPO as designated or elected Office.

For information on the Central Fee Payment service, refer to Notice from the
European Patent Office dated 19 July 2022 concerning Central Fee Payment (OJ
EPO 2022, A81).

c) A deposit account may be opened at the request of the prospective account
holder, who must provide all the necessary particulars about their identity,
occupation and address. This is done by completing and submitting the online
request form available on the EPO website under Applying for a patent -> Fees
-> Fee payments and refunds.

Once the deposit account has been opened, its number is communicated to the
holder, who must then make an initial payment commensurate with their
requirements and the intended frequency of replenishment, so as to ensure that
there are sufficient funds in the account. Payments to replenish deposit
accounts must be made in euro into the EPO bank account indicated above
(section b)).  
The account holder must ensure that the account contains sufficient funds at
all times. Debiting occurs only on the basis of an electronic debit order
signed by the account holder or the authorised representative.

The debit order may be:  
— a debit order for individual fees for one or more patent applications, i.e.
a single or a batch debit order, or  
— an automatic debit order for one or more patent applications, authorising
the EPO to debit fees automatically as the proceedings progress.

The debit order must be filed in an electronically processable format (xml)
via one of the following:  
— EPO Online Filing or ePCT using the PCT fee calculation and payment feature,
or  
— Online Filing 2.0 using the PCT fee calculator and payment feature with
Forms PCT/RO/101 and PCT/IPEA/401; or  
— Central Fee Payment.

For further information on the procedure for paying by debiting a deposit
account, refer to Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) and their annexes
(Supplementary publication 2, OJ EPO 2024).

Annex C - Receiving Office

Does the receiving Office accept the submission of pre-conversion documents
and, if yes, in which format (Section 706 of the PCT Administrative
Instructions)?

Yes. The files should be archived in ZIP format and contain either plain ASCII
text or be created with one of the following word processing programs:  
— Microsoft Word 97 and later releases  
— Corel WordPerfect 6.1, 8 & 10 and later releases  
— Writer of OpenOffice 2.0 and later releases (including the corresponding
StarOffice products).

  

Does the receiving Office accept incorporation by reference (PCT Rule 20.6)?

Yes

  

Does the receiving Office accept the submission of color drawings on an
informal basis and transmit them to the International Bureau?

Yes, the EPO as receiving Office accepts the submission of colour drawings and
photographs and transmits them to the IB who makes them available on
Patentscope. However, for the purposes of file inspection and publication
colour drawings are converted into black and white. As a consequence, details
of colour drawings or photographs may be lost. The EPO is planning to
implement the processing of colour drawings and photographs in the near
future.

  

  
Annex E - International Preliminary Examining Authority

Are there any restrictions with regard to the competence of the Authority
acting as an International Preliminary Examining Authority?

The EPO acts as International Preliminary Examination Authority under the
condition only if the international search is or has been performed by the EPO
acting as International Searching Authority or another International Searching
Authority located in and operating for any State party to the European Patent
Convention has prepared the international search report (Annex A EPO-WIPO
Agreement). These International Searching Authorities are the Austrian Patent
Office, the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH), the Nordic Patent
Institute, the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office, the Swedish Intellectual
Property Office (PRV), the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office (Turkpatent) or
the Visegrad Patent Institute.  
In addition, the EPO as International Preliminary Examination Authority (IPEA)
will not consider a written opinion established by any International Searching
Authority other than the EPO itself as a written opinion of the IPEA for the
purposes of PCT Rule 66.2(a) and has notified the International Bureau
accordingly under PCT Rule 66.1 _bis_(b).

  

  
Summary of requirements for entry into the national phase

Does the Office permit reinstatement of rights (PCT Rule 49.6)?

Yes, reinstatement of rights is available in respect of the acts referred to
in Article 22 PCT (payment of the national filing fee and filing the
translation, as required). The EPO applies the “due care” criterion to such
requests. It is noted that this remedy has only advantages if the period for
requesting further processing in respect of these or any other omitted act(s)
required for entering the European phase has already expired. Reference is
made to sections EP.15, EP.25 and EP.26 in respect of the consequences to meet
the time limit(s) for entering the European phase and the applicable legal
remedies.

  

Does the Office accept color drawings under its national law?

Yes, the EPO as designated/elected Office accepts the submission of colour
drawings and photographs. These are, however, converted into black and white
for the purposes of file inspection and publication. As a consequence, details
of colour drawings or photographs may be lost. The EPO is planning to
implement the processing of colour drawings and photographs in the near
future.

  

Does the Office accept the effect of restoration of the right of priority by
the receiving Office (PCT Rule 49 _ter_.1)?

Yes
