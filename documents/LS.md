PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41,  LPL Sec. 8(2)

LPL Sec. 14(5)  
In order to maintain the patent or patent application, annual fees must be
paid in advance to the Registrar for each year, starting one year after the
filing date of the application for the grant of the patent. The first annual
fee is due within 24 months from the international filing date; however, where
Article 39(1) applies, it is due within 31 months from the priority date if
that time limit expires later. Any annual fee may, together with the
prescribed surcharge, be paid within six months after its due date. The
amounts of the annual fees and the surcharge for late payment are set out in
Annex LS.I.

LS.09 EXTENSION OF PATENT TERM

LPL Sec. 14(1),  LPL Sec. 14(2),  LPR Sec. 29  
The normal patent term expires at the end of the 15th year after the filing

months and not less than one month before the expiration of the patent term.

invention is being worked sufficiently in Lesotho at the date of the request
or that there are circumstances which justify the failure to so work the
invention.

The Registrar will decide on the request for extension of the patent term
within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of the request.

applications filed before 1 January 2004, this must have been indicated in the
international application (in Box No. V of the request) when filed; for
international applications filed on or after 1 January 2004, since the request
form no longer provides for the furnishing of such an indication, the
applicant, when performing the acts referred to in Article 22 or 39, shall so

Annex LS.I.

LS.15 CONVERSION
