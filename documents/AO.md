AO.02 FEES (MANNER OF PAYMENT)

outlined in Annex AO.I.

to substance. A request for examination must be filed within three years from
the international filing date. The request is subject to the payment of a fee
which is indicated in Annex AO.I.

AO.04 POWER OF ATTORNEY

An agent must be appointed by filing a power of attorney if the applicant is
not a resident in Angola. If the power of attorney is not filed at the time of
entry into the national phase, it may be filed within two months from the
expiration of that time limit.

AO.05 AMENDMENT OF THE APPLICATION; TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 28,  PCT Art. 41  
The applicant may amend or correct the claims, description and drawings in the
international application provided that the scope of the subject matter of the
application is not broadened thereby. The applicant may file voluntary
amendments during the processing of the international application and after
grant. Such amendments are subject to the payment of a fee as indicated in
Annex AO.I.

AO.06

Where, after taking due account of the international search and international
preliminary examination reports, the Office concludes that the application
does not comply with the criteria for patentability, it will notify the
applicant accordingly and invite him to submit his observations and, where
needed, amendments to the application together with a request that the matter
be reconsidered. The Office will allow not less than two and not more than six
months for the submission of the observations and amendments.

AO.07 ANNUAL FEES

Annual fees are due on the eve of each anniversary of the international filing
date. The Office will issue a reminder to the applicant concerning payment of
the annual fee at least one month prior to the date on which the annual fee is
due. Subject to the payment of a surcharge (for the amount, refer to Annex
AO.I), annual fees may be paid up to six months after the date. Any annual fee
which falls due during the international phase need not be paid until the
expiration of the applicable time limit for the entry into the national phase.

AO.08 EXCUSE OF DELAYS IN MEETING TIME LIMITS

PCT Art. 24(2),  PCT Art. 48(2),  PCT Rule 82 _bis_  
Reference is made to paragraphs 6.022 to 6.027 of the National Phase. At the

Such extension may be granted even if the time limit has already expired.

AO.09 UTILITY MODEL

PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1,  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(a),  PCT Rule 49 _bis_.1(b),  PCT
Rule 76.5

(i) instead of a patent, or

(ii) in addition to a patent,

the applicant, when performing the acts referred to in Article 22 or 39, shall
so indicate to the Office.

AO.10

If the international application is for a utility model instead of a patent,
the requirements are basically the same as for patents. The time limit
applicable for entry into the national phase is 31 months under PCT Article 22
or 39(1) and the term of protection of utility models is 15 years from the
international filing date.

AO.11

If the international application is for both a utility model and a patent, the
applicant must, within the time limit applicable for entry into the national
phase, comply with the following requirements:

(i) pay two filing fees for both the patent and the utility model within 21
days from entry into the national phase;

(ii) where the international application was not filed in Portuguese, furnish
a translation into Portuguese in two copies, including the description and at
least one claim.

AO.12 CONVERSION

An international application for a patent may be converted into a utility
model application and _vice versa_. Conversion from a patent application into
a utility model application must be undertaken within 60 days from date of
entry into the national phase. The applicant can still apply to the Director
