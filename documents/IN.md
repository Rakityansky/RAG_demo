where amendments have been filed during the international phase, the claims as
amended under PCT Article 19 or 34(2). Where the applicant fails to pay the
correct amount of the claims fee within the prescribed time limit, the

renewal fee is not paid within the prescribed time limit, the patent will
cease to have effect. However, a patent may be restored provided that an
application for restoration is made on Form 15 (refer to Annex IN.XIV) within
18 months from the date of cessation (refer to paragraph IN.15). Where the
patent is granted later than two years after filing, the fees which have
become due must be paid within three months of grant (extendable up to an
